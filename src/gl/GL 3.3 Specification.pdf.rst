Chapter 1

Introduction

This document describes the OpenGL graphics system: what it is, how it acts, and
what is required to implement it. We assume that the reader has at least a rudi-
mentary understanding of computer graphics. This means familiarity with the es-
sentials of computer graphics algorithms as well as familiarity with basic graphics
hardware and associated terms.


1.1    Formatting of the OpenGL Specification

1.2    What is the OpenGL Graphics System?
OpenGL (for “Open Graphics Library”) is a software interface to graphics hard-
ware. The interface consists of a set of several hundred procedures and functions
that allow a programmer to specify the objects and operations involved in produc-
ing high-quality graphical images, specifically color images of three-dimensional
objects.
    Most of OpenGL requires that the graphics hardware contain a framebuffer.
Many OpenGL calls pertain to drawing objects such as points, lines, and polygons,
but the way that some of this drawing occurs (such as when antialiasing is enabled)
relies on the existence of a framebuffer. Further, some of OpenGL is specifically
concerned with framebuffer manipulation.


1.3    Programmer’s View of OpenGL
To the programmer, OpenGL is a set of commands that allow the specification of
geometric objects in two or three dimensions, together with commands that control
how these objects are rendered into the framebuffer.

                                        1
1.4. IMPLEMENTOR’S VIEW OF OPENGL                                                  2


    A typical program that uses OpenGL begins with calls to open a window into
the framebuffer into which the program will draw. Then, calls are made to allocate
a GL context and associate it with the window. Once a GL context is allocated,
the programmer is free to issue OpenGL commands. Some calls are used to draw
simple geometric objects (i.e. points, line segments, and polygons), while others
affect the rendering of these primitives including how they are lit or colored and
how they are mapped from the user’s two- or three-dimensional model space to
the two-dimensional screen. There are also calls to effect direct control of the
framebuffer, such as reading and writing pixels.


1.4    Implementor’s View of OpenGL
To the implementor, OpenGL is a set of commands that affect the operation of
graphics hardware. If the hardware consists only of an addressable framebuffer,
then OpenGL must be implemented almost entirely on the host CPU. More typi-
cally, the graphics hardware may comprise varying degrees of graphics accelera-
tion, from a raster subsystem capable of rendering two-dimensional lines and poly-
gons to sophisticated floating-point processors capable of transforming and com-
puting on geometric data. The OpenGL implementor’s task is to provide the CPU
software interface while dividing the work for each OpenGL command between
the CPU and the graphics hardware. This division must be tailored to the available
graphics hardware to obtain optimum performance in carrying out OpenGL calls.
    OpenGL maintains a considerable amount of state information. This state con-
trols how objects are drawn into the framebuffer. Some of this state is directly
available to the user: he or she can make calls to obtain its value. Some of it, how-
ever, is visible only by the effect it has on what is drawn. One of the main goals of
this specification is to make OpenGL state information explicit, to elucidate how it
changes, and to indicate what its effects are.


1.5    Our View
We view OpenGL as a pipeline having some programmable stages and some state-
driven stages that control a set of specific drawing operations. This model should
engender a specification that satisfies the needs of both programmers and imple-
mentors. It does not, however, necessarily provide a model for implementation. An
implementation must produce results conforming to those produced by the speci-
fied methods, but there may be ways to carry out a particular computation that are
more efficient than the one specified.

1.6. THE DEPRECATION MODEL                                                       3


1.6     The Deprecation Model
GL features marked as deprecated in one version of the specification are expected
to be removed in a future version, allowing applications time to transition away
from use of deprecated features. The deprecation model is described in more detail,
together with a summary of the commands and state deprecated from this version
of the API, in appendix E.


1.7     Companion Documents
1.7.1   OpenGL Shading Language
This specification should be read together with a companion document titled The
OpenGL Shading Language. The latter document (referred to as the OpenGL Shad-
ing Language Specification hereafter) defines the syntax and semantics of the pro-
gramming language used to write vertex and fragment shaders (see sections 2.11
and 3.9). These sections may include references to concepts and terms (such as
shading language variable types) defined in the companion document.
    OpenGL 3.3 implementations are guaranteed to support version 3.30 of the
OpenGL Shading Language. All references to sections of that specification refer
to version 3.30. The supported version of the shading language may be queried as
described in section 6.1.5.

1.7.2   Window System Bindings
OpenGL requires a companion API to create and manage graphics contexts, win-
dows to render into, and other resources beyond the scope of this Specification.
There are several such APIs supporting different operating and window systems.
    OpenGL Graphics with the X Window System, also called the “GLX Specifica-
tion”, describes the GLX API for use of OpenGL in the X Window System. It is
primarily directed at Linux and Unix systems, but GLX implementations also exist
for Microsoft Windows, MacOS X, and some other platforms where X is avail-
able. The GLX Specification is available in the OpenGL Extension Registry (see
appendix J).
    The WGL API supports use of OpenGL with Microsoft Windows. WGL is
documented in Microsoft’s MSDN system, although no full specification exists.
    Several APIs exist supporting use of OpenGL with Quartz, the MacOS X win-
dow system, including CGL, AGL, and NSOpenGLView. These APIs are docu-
mented on Apple’s developer website.

OpenGL Operation

2.1    OpenGL Fundamentals
OpenGL (henceforth, the “GL”) is concerned only with rendering into a frame-
buffer (and reading values stored in that framebuffer). There is no support for
other peripherals sometimes associated with graphics hardware, such as mice and
keyboards. Programmers must rely on other mechanisms to obtain user input.
    The GL draws primitives subject to a number of selectable modes and shader
programs. Each primitive is a point, line segment, or polygon. Each mode may
be changed independently; the setting of one does not affect the settings of oth-
ers (although many modes may interact to determine what eventually ends up in
the framebuffer). Modes are set, primitives specified, and other GL operations
described by sending commands in the form of function or procedure calls.
    Primitives are defined by a group of one or more vertices. A vertex defines
a point, an endpoint of an edge, or a corner of a polygon where two edges meet.
Data such as positional coordinates, colors, normals, texture coordinates, etc. are
associated with a vertex and each vertex is processed independently, in order, and
in the same way. The only exception to this rule is if the group of vertices must
be clipped so that the indicated primitive fits within a specified region; in this
case vertex data may be modified and new vertices created. The type of clipping
depends on which primitive the group of vertices represents.
    Commands are always processed in the order in which they are received, al-
though there may be an indeterminate delay before the effects of a command are
realized. This means, for example, that one primitive must be drawn completely
before any subsequent one can affect the framebuffer. It also means that queries
and pixel read operations return state consistent with complete execution of all
previously invoked GL commands, except where explicitly specified otherwise. In

2.1. OPENGL FUNDAMENTALS                                                               6


general, the effects of a GL command on either GL modes or the framebuffer must
be complete before any subsequent command can have any such effects.
     In the GL, data binding occurs on call. This means that data passed to a com-
mand are interpreted when that command is received. Even if the command re-
quires a pointer to data, those data are interpreted when the call is made, and any
subsequent changes to the data have no effect on the GL (unless the same pointer
is used in a subsequent command).
     The GL provides direct control over the fundamental operations of 3D and 2D
graphics. This includes specification of parameters of application-defined shader
programs performing transformation, lighting, texturing, and shading operations,
as well as built-in functionality such as antialiasing and texture filtering. It does not
provide a means for describing or modeling complex geometric objects. Another
way to describe this situation is to say that the GL provides mechanisms to de-
scribe how complex geometric objects are to be rendered rather than mechanisms
to describe the complex objects themselves.
     The model for interpretation of GL commands is client-server. That is, a pro-
gram (the client) issues commands, and these commands are interpreted and pro-
cessed by the GL (the server). The server may or may not operate on the same
computer as the client. In this sense, the GL is “network-transparent.” A server
may maintain a number of GL contexts, each of which is an encapsulation of cur-
rent GL state. A client may choose to connect to any one of these contexts. Issuing
GL commands when the program is not connected to a context results in undefined
behavior.
     The GL interacts with two classes of framebuffers: window system-provided
and application-created. There is at most one window system-provided framebuffer
at any time, referred to as the default framebuffer. Application-created frame-
buffers, referred to as framebuffer objects, may be created as desired. These two
types of framebuffer are distinguished primarily by the interface for configuring
and managing their state.
     The effects of GL commands on the default framebuffer are ultimately con-
trolled by the window system, which allocates framebuffer resources, determines
which portions of the default framebuffer the GL may access at any given time, and
communicates to the GL how those portions are structured. Therefore, there are
no GL commands to initialize a GL context or configure the default framebuffer.
Similarly, display of framebuffer contents on a physical display device (including
the transformation of individual framebuffer values by such techniques as gamma
correction) is not addressed by the GL.
     Allocation and configuration of the default framebuffer occurs outside of the
GL in conjunction with the window system, using companion APIs described in
section 1.7.2.

2.1. OPENGL FUNDAMENTALS                                                          7


     Allocation and initialization of GL contexts is also done using these companion
APIs. GL contexts can typically be associated with different default framebuffers,
and some context state is determined at the time this association is performed.
     It is possible to use a GL context without a default framebuffer, in which case
a framebuffer object must be used to perform all rendering. This is useful for
applications needing to perform offscreen rendering.
     The GL is designed to be run on a range of graphics platforms with varying
graphics capabilities and performance. To accommodate this variety, we specify
ideal behavior instead of actual behavior for certain GL operations. In cases where
deviation from the ideal is allowed, we also specify the rules that an implemen-
tation must obey if it is to approximate the ideal behavior usefully. This allowed
variation in GL behavior implies that two distinct GL implementations may not
agree pixel for pixel when presented with the same input even when run on identi-
cal framebuffer configurations.
     Finally, command names, constants, and types are prefixed in the GL (by gl,
GL_, and GL, respectively in C) to reduce name clashes with other packages. The
prefixes are omitted in this document for clarity.

2.1.1   Floating-Point Computation
The GL must perform a number of floating-point operations during the course of
its operation. In some cases, the representation and/or precision of such opera-
tions is defined or limited; by the OpenGL Shading Language Specification for
operations in shaders, and in some cases implicitly limited by the specified format
of vertex, texture, or renderbuffer data consumed by the GL. Otherwise, the rep-
resentation of such floating-point numbers, and the details of how operations on
them are performed, is not specified. We require simply that numbers’ floating-
point parts contain enough bits and that their exponent fields are large enough so
that individual results of floating-point operations are accurate to about 1 part in
105 . The maximum representable magnitude of a floating-point number used to
represent positional, normal, or texture coordinates must be at least 232 ; the max-
imum representable magnitude for colors must be at least 210 . The maximum
representable magnitude for all other floating-point values must be at least 232 .
x · 0 = 0 · x = 0 for any non-infinite and non-NaN x. 1 · x = x · 1 = x.
x + 0 = 0 + x = x. 00 = 1. (Occasionally further requirements will be specified.)
Most single-precision floating-point formats meet these requirements.
    The special values Inf and −Inf encode values with magnitudes too large to
be represented; the special value NaN encodes “Not A Number” values resulting
from undefined arithmetic operations such as 00 . Implementations are permitted,
but not required, to support Inf s and NaN s in their floating-point computations.

    Any representable floating-point value is legal as input to a GL command that
requires floating-point data. The result of providing a value that is not a floating-
point number to such a command is unspecified, but must not lead to GL interrup-
tion or termination. In IEEE arithmetic, for example, providing a negative zero or a
denormalized number to a GL command yields predictable results, while providing
a NaN or an infinity yields unspecified results.
    Some calculations require division. In such cases (including implied divisions
required by vector normalizations), a division by zero produces an unspecified re-
sult but must not lead to GL interruption or termination.

2.1.2   16-Bit Floating-Point Numbers
A 16-bit floating-point number has a 1-bit sign (S), a 5-bit exponent (E), and a
10-bit mantissa (M ). The value V of a 16-bit floating-point number is determined
by the following:

    Any representable 16-bit floating-point value is legal as input to a GL command
that accepts 16-bit floating-point data. The result of providing a value that is not a
floating-point number (such as Inf or NaN ) to such a command is unspecified, but
must not lead to GL interruption or termination. Providing a denormalized number
or negative zero to GL must yield predictable results.

An unsigned 11-bit floating-point number has no sign bit, a 5-bit exponent (E), and
a 6-bit mantissa (M ). The value V of an unsigned 11-bit floating-point number is

    When a floating-point value is converted to an unsigned 11-bit floating-point
representation, finite values are rounded to the closest representable finite value.
While less accurate, implementations are allowed to always round in the direction
of zero. This means negative values are converted to zero. Likewise, finite posi-
tive values greater than 65024 (the maximum finite representable unsigned 11-bit
floating-point value) are converted to 65024. Additionally: negative infinity is con-
verted to zero; positive infinity is converted to positive infinity; and both positive
and negative NaN are converted to positive NaN .
    Any representable unsigned 11-bit floating-point value is legal as input to a
GL command that accepts 11-bit floating-point data. The result of providing a
value that is not a floating-point number (such as Inf or NaN ) to such a command
is unspecified, but must not lead to GL interruption or termination. Providing a
denormalized number to GL must yield predictable results.

2.1.4   Unsigned 10-Bit Floating-Point Numbers
An unsigned 10-bit floating-point number has no sign bit, a 5-bit exponent (E), and

2.1.5   Fixed-Point Data Conversions
When generic vertex attributes and pixel color or depth components are repre-
sented as integers, they are often (but not always) considered to be normalized.
Normalized integer values are treated specially when being converted to and from
floating-point values, and are usually referred to as normalized fixed-point. Such
values are always either signed or unsigned.
     In the remainder of this section, b denotes the bit width of the fixed-point in-
teger representation. When the integer is one of the types defined in table 2.2, b
is the minimum required bit width of that type. When the integer is a texture or
renderbuffer color or depth component (see section 3.8.3), b is the number of bits
allocated to that component in the internal format of the texture or renderbuffer.
When the integer is a framebuffer color or depth component (see section 4), b is
the number of bits allocated to that component in the framebuffer. For framebuffer
and renderbuffer A components, b must be at least 2 if the buffer does not contain
an A component, or if there is only 1 bit of A in the buffer.
     The signed and unsigned fixed-point representations are assumed to be b-bit
binary twos-complement integers and binary unsigned integers, respectively. The
signed fixed-point representation may be treated in one of two ways, as discussed
below.

   All the conversions described below are performed as defined, even if the im-
plemented range of an integer data type is greater than the minimum required range.

Conversion from Normalized Fixed-Point to Floating-Point
Unsigned normalized fixed-point integers represent numbers in the range [0, 1].
The conversion from an unsigned normalized fixed-point value c to the correspond-
ing floating-point value f is defined as
                                                c
                                      f=           .                                (2.1)
                                           2b   −1
    Signed normalized fixed-point integers represent numbers in the range [−1, 1].
The conversion from a signed normalized fixed-point value c to the corresponding
floating-point value f may be performed in two ways:
                                            2c + 1
                                      f=                                            (2.2)
                                            2b − 1
    In this case the full range of the representation is used, so that −2b−1 corre-
sponds to -1.0 and 2b−1 − 1 corresponds to 1.0. For example, if b = 8, then the
integer value -128 corresponds to -1.0 and the value 127 corresponds to 1.0. Note
that it is not possible to exactly express 0 in this representation. In general, this rep-
resentation is used for signed normalized fixed-point parameters in GL commands,
such as vertex attribute values.
    Alternatively, conversion may be performed using

                                            c
                            f = max               , −1.0 .                          (2.3)
                                         2b−1 − 1
    In this case only the range [−2b−1 + 1, 2b−1 − 1] is used to represent signed
fixed-point values in the range [−1, 1]. For example, if b = 8, then the integer
value -127 corresponds to -1.0 and the value 127 corresponds to 1.0. Note that
while zero can be exactly expressed in this representation, one value (-128 in the
example) is outside the representable range, and must be clamped before use. In
general, this representation is used for signed normalized fixed-point texture or
framebuffer values.
    Everywhere that signed normalized fixed-point values are converted, the equa-
tion used is specified.

Conversion from Floating-Point to Normalized Fixed-Point
The conversion from a floating-point value f to the corresponding unsigned nor-
malized fixed-point value c is defined by first clamping f to the range [0, 1], then
computing

                                f = f × (2b − 1).                              (2.4)
f is then cast to an unsigned binary integer value with exactly b bits.
   The conversion from a floating-point value f to the corresponding signed nor-
malized fixed-point value c may be performed in two ways, both beginning by
clamping f to the range [−1, 1]:

                               f = f × (2b − 1) − 1
                                                                               (2.5)
                                         2
    In general, this conversion is used when querying floating-point state (see sec-
tion 6) and returning integers.
    Alternatively, conversion may be performed using

                              f = f × (2b−1 − 1).                              (2.6)
    In general, this conversion is used when specifying signed normalized fixed-
point texture or framebuffer values.
    After conversion, f is then cast to a signed two’s-complement binary integer
value with exactly b bits.
    Everywhere that floating-point values are converted to signed normalized fixed-
point, the equation used is specified.


2.2    GL State
The GL maintains considerable state. This document enumerates each state vari-
able and describes how each variable can be changed. For purposes of discussion,
state variables are categorized somewhat arbitrarily by their function. Although we
describe the operations that the GL performs on the framebuffer, the framebuffer
is not a part of GL state.
    We distinguish two types of state. The first type of state, called GL server
state, resides in the GL server. The majority of GL state falls into this category.
The second type of state, called GL client state, resides in the GL client. Unless
otherwise specified, all state referred to in this document is GL server state; GL
client state is specifically identified. Each instance of a GL context implies one

complete set of GL server state; each connection from a client to a server implies
a set of both GL client state and GL server state.
    While an implementation of the GL may be hardware dependent, this discus-
sion is independent of the specific hardware on which a GL is implemented. We are
therefore concerned with the state of graphics hardware only when it corresponds
precisely to GL state.

2.2.1    Shared Object State
It is possible for groups of contexts to share certain state. Enabling such sharing
between contexts is done through window system binding APIs such as those de-
scribed in section 1.7.2. These APIs are responsible for creation and management
of contexts, and not discussed further here. More detailed discussion of the behav-
ior of shared objects is included in appendix D. Except as defined in this appendix,
all state in a context is specific to that context only.


2.3     GL Command Syntax
GL commands are functions or procedures. Various groups of commands perform
the same operation but differ in how arguments are supplied to them. To conve-
niently accommodate this variation, we adopt a notation for describing commands
and their arguments.
    GL commands are formed from a name which may be followed, depending on
the particular command, by a sequence of characters describing a parameter to the
command. If present, a digit indicates the required length (number of values) of the
indicated type. Next, a string of characters making up one of the type descriptors
from table 2.1 indicates the specific size and data type of parameter values. A
final v character, if present, indicates that the command takes a pointer to an array
(a vector) of values rather than a series of individual arguments. Two specific
examples are:

        void Uniform4f( int location, float v0, float v1,
           float v2, float v3 );

and

        void GetFloatv( enum value, float *data );

types. Refer to table 2.2 for definitions of the GL types.



    These examples show the ANSI C declarations for these commands. In general,
a command declaration has the form1

       rtype Name{ 1234}{ b s i i64 f d ub us ui ui64}{ v}
                       ( [args ,] T arg1 , . . . , T argN [, args] );

rtype is the return type of the function. The braces ({}) enclose a series of type
descriptors (see table 2.1), of which one is selected. indicates no type descriptor.
The arguments enclosed in brackets ([args ,] and [, args]) may or may not be
present. The N arguments arg1 through argN have type T, which corresponds to
one of the type descriptors indicated in table 2.1 (if there are no letters, then the
arguments’ type is given explicitly). If the final character is not v, then N is given
by the digit 1, 2, 3, or 4 (if there is no digit, then the number of arguments is fixed).
If the final character is v, then only arg1 is present and it is an array of N values of
the indicated type.
     For example,

       void Uniform{1234}{if}( int location, T value );

indicates the eight declarations

       void Uniform1i( int location, int value );

     The declarations shown in this document apply to ANSI C. Languages such as C++ and Ada
that allow passing of argument type information admit simpler declarations and fewer entry points.

2.4    Basic GL Operation
Figure 2.1 shows a schematic diagram of the GL. Commands enter the GL on the
left. Some commands specify geometric objects to be drawn while others control
how the objects are handled by the various stages. Commands are effectively sent
through a processing pipeline.
     The first stage operates on geometric primitives described by vertices: points,
line segments, and polygons. In this stage vertices may be transformed and lit,
followed by assembly into geometric primitives, which may optionally be used by
the next stage, geometry shading, to generate new primitives. The final resulting
primitives are clipped to a viewing volume in preparation for the next stage, ras-
terization. The rasterizer produces a series of framebuffer addresses and values
using a two-dimensional description of a point, line segment, or polygon. Each
fragment so produced is fed to the next stage that performs operations on individ-
ual fragments before they finally alter the framebuffer. These operations include
conditional updates into the framebuffer based on incoming and previously stored
depth values (to effect depth buffering), blending of incoming fragment colors with
stored colors, as well as masking and other logical operations on fragment values.
     Finally, values may also be read back from the framebuffer or copied from one
portion of the framebuffer to another. These transfers may include some type of
decoding or encoding.
     This ordering is meant only as a tool for describing the GL, not as a strict rule
of how the GL is implemented, and we present it only as a means to organize the
various operations of the GL. Objects such as curved surfaces, for instance, may
be transformed before they are converted to polygons.

Table 2.2: GL data types. GL types are not C types. Thus, for example, GL
type int is referred to as GLint outside this document, and is not necessarily
equivalent to the C type int. An implementation may use more bits than the
number indicated in the table to represent a GL type. Correct interpretation of
integer values outside the minimum range is not required, however.
ptrbits is the number of bits required to represent a pointer type; in other words,
types intptr, sizeiptr, and sync must be sufficiently large as to store any
address.

2.5    GL Errors
The GL detects only a subset of those conditions that could be considered errors.
This is because in many cases error checking would adversely impact the perfor-
mance of an error-free program.
   The command

      enum GetError( void );

is used to obtain error information. Each detectable error is assigned a numeric
code. When an error is detected, a flag is set and the code is recorded. Further
errors, if they occur, do not affect this recorded code. When GetError is called,
the code is returned and the flag is cleared, so that a further error will again record
its code. If a call to GetError returns NO_ERROR, then there has been no detectable
error since the last call to GetError (or since the GL was initialized).
     To allow for distributed implementations, there may be several flag-code pairs.
In this case, after a call to GetError returns a value other than NO_ERROR each
subsequent call returns the non-zero code of a distinct flag-code pair (in unspecified
order), until all non-NO_ERROR codes have been returned. When there are no more
non-NO_ERROR error codes, all flags are reset. This scheme requires some positive
number of pairs of a flag bit and an integer. The initial state of all flags is cleared
and the initial value of all codes is NO_ERROR.
     Table 2.3 summarizes GL errors. Currently, when an error flag is set, results of
GL operation are undefined only if OUT_OF_MEMORY has occurred. In other cases,
the command generating the error is ignored so that it has no effect on GL state or
framebuffer contents. If the generating command returns a value, it returns zero. If
the generating command modifies values through a pointer argument, no change is
made to these values. These error semantics apply only to GL errors, not to system
errors such as memory access errors. This behavior is the current behavior; the
action of the GL in the presence of errors is subject to change.
     Several error generation conditions are implicit in the description of every GL
command:

   • If a command that requires an enumerated value is passed a symbolic con-
     stant that is not one of those specified as allowable for that command, the
     error INVALID_ENUM is generated. This is the case even if the argument is
     a pointer to a symbolic constant, if the value pointed to is not allowable for
     the given command.

   • If a negative number is provided where an argument of type sizei or
     sizeiptr is specified, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.

   • If memory is exhausted as a side effect of the execution of a command, the
     error OUT_OF_MEMORY may be generated.

Otherwise, errors are generated only for conditions that are explicitly described in
this specification.


2.6      Primitives and Vertices
     In the GL, most geometric objects are drawn by specifying a series of generic
attribute sets using DrawArrays or one of the other drawing commands defined in
section 2.8.3. Points, lines, polygons, and a variety of related geometric objects
(see section 2.6.1) can be drawn in this way.
     Each vertex is specified with one or more generic vertex attributes. Each at-
tribute is specified with one, two, three, or four scalar values. Generic vertex
attributes can be accessed from within vertex shaders (section 2.11) and used to
compute values for consumption by later processing stages.
     The methods by which generic attributes are sent to the GL, as well as how
attributes are used by vertex shaders to generate vertices mapped to the two-
dimensional screen, are discussed later.
     Before vertex shader execution, the state required by a vertex is its generic
vertex attributes. Vertex shader execution processes vertices producing a homo-
geneous vertex position and any varying outputs explicitly written by the vertex
shader.
     Figure 2.2 shows the sequence of operations that builds a primitive (point, line
segment, or polygon) from a sequence of vertices. After a primitive is formed, it
is clipped to a viewing volume. This may alter the primitive by altering vertex

primitives, clipping may insert new vertices into the primitive. The vertices defin-
ing a primitive to be rasterized have varying outputs associated with them.

2.6.1   Primitive Types
A sequence of vertices is passed to the GL using DrawArrays or one of the other
drawing commands defined in section 2.8.3. There is no limit to the number of
vertices that may be specified, other than the size of the vertex arrays. The mode
parameter of these commands determines the type of primitives to be drawn using
the vertices. The types, and the corresponding mode parameters, are:

Points
    A series of individual points may be specified with mode POINTS. Each vertex
defines a separate point.

Line Strips
     A series of one or more connected line segments may be specified with mode
LINE_STRIP. In this case, the first vertex specifies the first segment’s start point
while the second vertex specifies the first segment’s endpoint and the second seg-
ment’s start point. In general, the ith vertex (for i > 1) specifies the beginning of
the ith segment and the end of the i − 1st. The last vertex specifies the end of the
last segment. If only one vertex is specified, then no primitive is generated.
     The required state consists of the processed vertex produced from the last ver-
tex that was sent (so that a line segment can be generated from it to the current
vertex), and a boolean flag indicating if the current vertex is the first vertex.

Line Loops
     Line loops may be specified with mode LINE_LOOP. Loops are the same as
line strips except that a final segment is added from the final specified vertex to the
first vertex. The required state consists of the processed first vertex, in addition to
the state required for line strips.

Separate Lines
    Individual line segments, each specified by a pair of vertices, may be speci-
fied with mode LINES. The first two vertices passed define the first segment, with
subsequent pairs of vertices each defining one more segment. If the number of
specified vertices is odd, then the last one is ignored. The state required is the same
as for line strips but it is used differently: a processed vertex holding the first vertex
of the current segment, and a boolean flag indicating whether the current vertex is
odd or even (a segment start or end).

   that in (a) and (b) triangle edge ordering is determined by the first triangle, while in
   (c) the order of each triangle’s edges is independent of the other triangles.




Triangle Strips
    A triangle strip is a series of triangles connected along shared edges, and may
be specified with mode TRIANGLE_STRIP. In this case, the first three vertices
define the first triangle (and their order is significant). Each subsequent vertex
defines a new triangle using that point along with two vertices from the previous
triangle. If fewer than three vertices are specified, no primitive is produced. See
figure 2.3.
    The required state consists of a flag indicating if the first triangle has been
completed, two stored processed vertices, (called vertex A and vertex B), and a
one bit pointer indicating which stored vertex will be replaced with the next vertex.
The pointer is initialized to point to vertex A. Each successive vertex toggles the
pointer. Therefore, the first vertex is stored as vertex A, the second stored as vertex
B, the third stored as vertex A, and so on. Any vertex after the second one sent
forms a triangle from vertex A, vertex B, and the current vertex (in that order).

Triangle Fans
    A triangle fan is the same as a triangle strip with one exception: each vertex
after the first always replaces vertex B of the two stored vertices. A triangle fan
may be specified with mode TRIANGLE_FAN.

Separate Triangles
   Separate triangles are specified with mode TRIANGLES. In this case, The 3i +

1st, 3i + 2nd, and 3i + 3rd vertices (in that order) determine a triangle for each
i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, where there are 3n + k vertices drawn. k is either 0, 1, or 2; if
k is not zero, the final k vertices are ignored. For each triangle, vertex A is vertex
3i and vertex B is vertex 3i + 1. Otherwise, separate triangles are the same as a
triangle strip.

Lines with Adjacency
     Lines with adjacency are independent line segments where each endpoint has
a corresponding adjacent vertex that can be accessed by a geometry shader (sec-
tion 2.12). If a geometry shader is not active, the adjacent vertices are ignored.
They are generated with mode LINES_ADJACENCY.

and 4i + 4th vertices are considered adjacent to the 4i + 2nd and 4i + 3rd vertices,
respectively (see figure 2.4).

    Line strips with adjacency are similar to line strips, except that each line seg-
ment has a pair of adjacent vertices that can be accessed by a geometry shader. If a
geometry shader is not active, the adjacent vertices are ignored. They are generated
with mode LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY.
    A line segment is drawn from the i + 2nd vertex to the i + 3rd vertex for each
i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, where there are n + 3 vertices passed. If there are fewer than
four vertices, all vertices are ignored. For line segment i, the i + 1st and i + 4th
vertex are considered adjacent to the i + 2nd and i + 3rd vertices, respectively (see
figure 2.4).

Triangles with Adjacency
    Triangles with adjacency are similar to separate triangles, except that each tri-
angle edge has an adjacent vertex that can be accessed by a geometry shader. If a
geometry shader is not active, the adjacent vertices are ignored. They are generated
with mode TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY.
    The 6i + 1st, 6i + 3rd, and 6i + 5th vertices (in that order) determine a triangle
for each i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, where there are 6n + k vertices passed. k is either
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; if k is non-zero, the final k vertices are ignored. For triangle i,
the i + 2nd, i + 4th, and i + 6th vertices are considered adjacent to edges from the
i + 1st to the i + 3rd, from the i + 3rd to the i + 5th, and from the i + 5th to the

triangle edge has an adjacent vertex that can be accessed by a geometry shader. If a

with mode TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY.
    In triangle strips with adjacency, n triangles are drawn where there are 2(n +
2) + k vertices passed. k is either 0 or 1; if k is 1, the final vertex is ignored. If
there are fewer than 6 vertices, the entire primitive is ignored. Table 2.4 describes
the vertices and order used to draw each triangle, and which vertices are considered
adjacent to each edge of the triangle (see figure 2.6).

Table 2.4: Triangles generated by triangle strips with adjacency. Each triangle
is drawn using the vertices whose numbers are in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns
under primitive vertices, in that order. The vertices in the 1/2, 2/3, and 3/1 columns
under adjacent vertices are considered adjacent to the edges from the first to the
second, from the second to the third, and from the third to the first vertex of the
triangle, respectively. The six rows correspond to six cases: the first and only
triangle (i = 0, n = 1), the first triangle of several (i = 0, n > 0), “odd” middle
triangles (i = 1, 3, 5 . . .), “even” middle triangles (i = 2, 4, 6, . . .), and special
cases for the last triangle, when i is either even or odd. For the purposes of this
table, the first vertex passed is numbered 1 and the first triangle is numbered 0.



    Depending on the current state of the GL, a polygon primitive generated from a
drawing command with mode TRIANGLE_FAN, TRIANGLE_STRIP, TRIANGLES,
TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY, or TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY may be rendered in
one of several ways, such as outlining its border or filling its interior. The order
of vertices in such a primitive is significant in polygon rasterization and fragment
shading (see sections 3.6.1 and 3.9.2).


2.7    Vertex Specification
Vertex shaders (see section 2.11) access an array of 4-component generic vertex
attributes . The first slot of this array is numbered 0, and the size of the array is
specified by the implementation-dependent constant MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.
     Current generic attribute values define generic attributes for a vertex when a
vertex array defining that data is not enabled, as described in section 2.8. The cur-
rent values of a generic shader attribute declared as a floating-point scalar, vector,
or matrix may be changed at any time by issuing one of the commands

      void VertexAttrib{1234}{sfd}( uint index, T values );


                        OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
2.7. VERTEX SPECIFICATION                                                         27


      void VertexAttrib{123}{sfd}v( uint index, const
         T values );
      void VertexAttrib4{bsifd ub us ui}v( uint index, const
         T values );
      void VertexAttrib4Nub( uint index, T values );
      void VertexAttrib4N{bsi ub us ui}v( uint index, const
         T values );

    The VertexAttrib4N* commands specify fixed-point values that are converted
to a normalized [0, 1] or [−1, 1] range as described in equations 2.1 and 2.2, re-
spectively, while the other commands specify values that are converted directly to
the internal floating-point representation.
    The resulting value(s) are loaded into the generic attribute at slot index, whose
components are named x, y, z, and w. The VertexAttrib1* family of commands
sets the x coordinate to the provided single argument while setting y and z to 0 and
w to 1. Similarly, VertexAttrib2* commands set x and y to the specified values,
z to 0 and w to 1; VertexAttrib3* commands set x, y, and z, with w set to 1, and
VertexAttrib4* commands set all four coordinates.
    The VertexAttrib* entry points may also be used to load shader attributes de-
clared as a floating-point matrix. Each column of a matrix takes up one generic
4-component attribute slot out of the MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS available slots. Ma-
trices are loaded into these slots in column major order. Matrix columns are loaded
in increasing slot numbers.
    The resulting attribute values are undefined if the base type of the shader at-
tribute at slot index is not floating-point (e.g. is signed or unsigned integer). To
load current values of a generic shader attribute declared as a signed or unsigned
scalar or vector, use the commands

      void VertexAttribI{1234}{i ui}( uint index, T values );
      void VertexAttribI{1234}{i ui}v( uint index, const
         T values );
      void VertexAttribI4{bs ubus}v( uint index, const
         T values );

    These commands specify values that are extended to full signed or unsigned
integers, then loaded into the generic attribute at slot index in the same fashion as
described above.
    The resulting attribute values are undefined if the base type of the shader at-
tribute at slot index is floating-point; if the base type is integer and unsigned in-
teger values are supplied (the VertexAttribI*ui, VertexAttribI*us, and Vertex-
AttribI*ub commands); or if the base type is unsigned integer and signed integer

values are supplied (the VertexAttribI*i, VertexAttribI*s, and VertexAttribI*b
commands)
    Vertex data may be stored as packed components within a larger natural type.
Such data may be specified using

      void VertexAttribP{1234}ui(uint index,enum
         type,boolean normalized,uint value)
      void VertexAttribP{1234}uiv(uint index,enum
         type,boolean normalized,const uint *value)

     These commands specify up to four attribute component values, packed into
a single natural type as described in section 2.8.2, and load it into the generic
attribute at slot index. The type parameter must be INT_2_10_10_10_REV or
UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV, specifying signed or unsigned data respec-
tively. The first one (x), two (x, y), three (x, y, z), or four (x, y, z, w) components
of the packed data are consumed by VertexAttribP1ui, VertexAttribP2ui, Ver-
texAttribP3ui, and VertexAttribP4ui, respectively. Data specified by VertexAt-
tribP* will be converted to floating point by normalizing if normalized is TRUE,
and converted directly to floating point otherwise. For VertexAttribP*uiv, value
contains the address of a single uint containing the packed attribute components.
     The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by VertexAttrib* if index is greater
than or equal to MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.
     The state required to support vertex specification consists of the value of
MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS four-component vectors to store generic vertex attributes.
     The initial values for all generic vertex attributes are (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).


2.8    Vertex Arrays
Vertex data is placed into arrays that are stored in the server’s address space (de-
scribed in section 2.9). Blocks of data in these arrays may then be used to specify
multiple geometric primitives through the execution of a single GL command. The
client may specify up to the value of MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS arrays to store one
or more generic vertex attributes. The commands

      void VertexAttribPointer( uint index, int size, enum type,
         boolean normalized, sizei stride, const
         void *pointer );
      void VertexAttribIPointer( uint index, int size, enum type,
         sizei stride, const void *pointer );

describe the locations and organizations of these arrays. For each command, type
specifies the data type of the values stored in the array. size indicates the number
of values per vertex that are stored in the array as well as their component order-
ing. Table 2.5 indicates the allowable values for size and type (when present).
For type the values BYTE, SHORT, INT, FLOAT, HALF_FLOAT, and DOUBLE indi-
cate types byte, short, int, float, half, and double, respectively; the
values UNSIGNED_BYTE, UNSIGNED_SHORT, and UNSIGNED_INT indicate types
ubyte, ushort, and uint, respectively; and the values INT_2_10_10_10_-
REV and UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV, indicating respectively four signed
or unsigned elements packed into a single uint, both correspond to the term
packed in that table.
     An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if size is not one of the values allowed
in table 2.5 for the corresponding command.
     An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated under any of the following con-
ditions:

   • size is BGRA and type is not UNSIGNED_BYTE, INT_2_10_10_10_REV or
     UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV;

   • type is INT_2_10_10_10_REV or UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV,
     and size is neither 4 or BGRA;
   • for VertexAttribPointer only, size is BGRA and normalized is FALSE;
   • any of the *Pointer commands specifying the location and organization of
     vertex array data are called while zero is bound to the ARRAY_BUFFER
     buffer object binding point (see section 2.9.6), and the pointer argument is
     not NULL.

    The index parameter in the VertexAttribPointer and VertexAttribIPointer
commands identifies the generic vertex attribute array being described. The er-
ror INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to the value of
MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS. Generic attribute arrays with integer type arguments can
be handled in one of three ways: converted to float by normalizing to [0, 1] or
[−1, 1] as described in equations 2.1 and 2.2, respectively; converted directly to
float, or left as integers. Data for an array specified by VertexAttribPointer will
be converted to floating-point by normalizing if normalized is TRUE, and converted
directly to floating-point otherwise. Data for an array specified by VertexAttribI-
Pointer will always be left as integer values; such data are referred to as pure
integers.
    The one, two, three, or four values in an array that correspond to a single ver-
tex comprise an array element. When size is BGRA, it indicates four values. The

Table 2.5: Vertex array sizes (values per vertex) and data types. The “Integer Han-
dling” column indicates how fixed-point data types are handled: “integer” means
that they remain as integer values, and “flag” means that they are either converted
to floating-point directly, or converted by normalizing to [0, 1] (for unsigned types)
or [−1, 1] (for signed types), depending on the setting of the normalized flag in
VertexAttribPointer. If size is BGRA, vertex array values are always normalized,
irrespective of the “normalize” table entry. packed is not a GL type, but indicates
commands accepting multiple components packed into a single uint.


values within each array element are stored sequentially in memory. However, if
size is BGRA, the first, second, third, and fourth values of each array element are
taken from the third, second, first, and fourth values in memory respectively. If
stride is specified as zero, then array elements are stored sequentially as well. The
error INVALID_VALUE is generated if stride is negative. Otherwise pointers to the
ith and (i + 1)st elements of an array differ by stride basic machine units (typi-
cally unsigned bytes), the pointer to the (i + 1)st element being greater. For each
command, pointer specifies the offset within a buffer of the first value of the first
element of the array being specified.
    An individual generic vertex attribute array is enabled or disabled by calling
one of

      void EnableVertexAttribArray( uint index );
      void DisableVertexAttribArray( uint index );

where index identifies the generic vertex attribute array to enable or disable. The
error INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to MAX_-
VERTEX_ATTRIBS.
    The command

      void VertexAttribDivisor( uint index, uint divisor );

modifies the rate at which generic vertex attributes advance when rendering multi-
ple instances of primitives in a single draw call. If divisor is zero, the attribute at
slot index advances once per vertex. If divisor is non-zero, the attribute advances
once per divisor instances of the set(s) of vertices being rendered. An attribute is
referred to as instanced if its divisor value is non-zero.
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index is greater than or equal to the
value of MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.

2.8.1    Transferring Array Elements
When an array element i is transferred to the GL by DrawArrays, DrawElements,
or the other Draw* commands described below, each generic attribute is expanded
to four components. If size is one then the x component of the attribute is specified
by the array; the y, z, and w components are implicitly set to 0, 0, and 1, respec-
tively. If size is two then the x and y components of the attribute are specified by
the array; the z and w components are implicitly set to 0 and 1, respectively. If size
is three then x, y, and z are specified, and w is implicitly set to 1. If size is four
then all components are specified.
     Primitive restarting is enabled or disabled by calling one of the commands

        void Enable( enum target );

and

        void Disable( enum target );

with target PRIMITIVE_RESTART. The command

        void PrimitiveRestartIndex( uint index );

specifies a vertex array element that is treated specially when primitive restarting
is enabled. This value is called the primitive restart index. When one of the
Draw* commands transfers a set of generic attribute array elements to the GL, if
the index within the vertex arrays corresponding to that set is equal to the primitive
restart index, then the GL does not process those elements as a vertex. Instead,
it is as if the drawing command ended with the immediately preceding transfer,
and another drawing command is immediately started with the same parameters,
but only transferring the immediately following element through the end of the
originally specified elements.
     When one of the *BaseVertex drawing commands specified in section 2.8.3 is
used, the primitive restart comparison occurs before the basevertex offset is added
to the array index.

2.8.2    Packed Vertex Data Formats
UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV and INT_2_10_10_10_REV vertex data for-
mats describe packed, 4 component formats stored in a single 32-bit word.
    For the UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV vertex data format, the first (x),
second (y), and third (z) components are represented as 10-bit unsigned integer
values and the fourth (w) omponent is represented as a 2-bit unsigned integer value.
    For the INT_2_10_10_10_REV vertex data format, the x, y and z compo-
nents are represented as 10-bit signed two’s complement integer values and the w
component is represented as a 2-bit signed two’s complement integer value.
    The normalized value is used to indicate whether to normalize the data to [0, 1]
(for unsigned types) or [−1, 1] (for signed types). During normalization, the con-
version rules specified in equations 2.1 and 2.2 are followed.
    Tables 2.6 and 2.7 describe how these components are laid out in a 32-bit word.

2.8.3    Drawing Commands
The command

        void DrawArraysOneInstance( enum mode, int first,
           sizei count, int instance );

does not exist in the GL, but is used to describe functionality in the rest of this sec-
tion. This command constructs a sequence of geometric primitives by transferring
elements first through first + count − 1 of each enabled array to the GL. mode

                     OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
2.8. VERTEX ARRAYS                                                               33


specifies what kind of primitives are constructed, as defined in section 2.6.1. If
mode is not a valid primitive type, an INVALID_ENUM error is generated. If count
is negative, an INVALID_VALUE error is generated.
     If an array corresponding to a generic attribute required by a vertex shader
is not enabled, then the corresponding element is taken from the current generic
attribute state (see section 2.7).
     If an array corresponding to a generic attribute required by a vertex shader is
enabled, the corresponding current generic attribute value is undefined after the
execution of DrawArraysOneInstance.
     Specifying f irst < 0 results in undefined behavior. Generating the error
INVALID_VALUE is recommended in this case.
     The command

      void DrawArrays( enum mode, int first, sizei count );

is equivalent to the command sequence

    DrawArraysOneInstance(mode, f irst, count, 0);

    The internal counter instanceID is a 32-bit integer value which may be read by
a vertex shader as gl_InstanceID, as described in section 2.11.4. The value of
this counter is always zero, except as noted below.
    The command

      void DrawArraysInstanced( enum mode, int first,
         sizei count, sizei primcount );

behaves identically to DrawArrays except that primcount instances of the range
of elements are executed, the value of instanceID advances for each iteration, and
the instanced elements advance per instance depending on the value of the divisor
for that vertex attribute set with VertexAttribDivisor. It has the same effect as:

    if (mode or count is invalid)
       generate appropriate error
    else {
       for (i = 0; i < primcount; i++) {
           instanceID = i;

    The command

      void MultiDrawArrays( enum mode, const int *first,
         const sizei *count, sizei primcount );

    behaves identically to DrawArraysInstanced except that primcount separate
ranges of elements are specified instead, all elements are treated as though they are
not instanced, and the value of instanceID stays at 0. It has the same effect as:

    if (mode is invalid)
       generate appropriate error
    else {
       for (i = 0; i < primcount; i++) {
           if (count[i] > 0)
              DrawArraysOneInstance(mode, f irst[i], count[i], 0);
       }
    }

    The command

      void DrawElementsOneInstance( enum mode, sizei count,
         enum type, const void *indices );

does not exist in the GL, but is used to describe functionality in the rest of this
section. This command constructs a sequence of geometric primitives by suc-
cessively transferring the count elements whose indices are stored in the currently
bound element array buffer (see section 2.9.7) at the offset defined by indices to
the GL. The ith element transferred by DrawElementsOneInstance will be taken
from element indices[i] of each enabled array. type must be one of UNSIGNED_-
BYTE, UNSIGNED_SHORT, or UNSIGNED_INT, indicating that the index values are
of GL type ubyte, ushort, or uint respectively. mode specifies what kind of
primitives are constructed, as defined in section 2.6.1.
     If an array corresponding to a generic attribute required by a vertex shader
is not enabled, then the corresponding element is taken from the current generic
attribute state (see section 2.7).
     If an array corresponding to a generic attribute required by a vertex shader is
enabled, the corresponding current generic attribute value is undefined after the
execution of DrawElementsOneInstance.
     The command

      void DrawElements( enum mode, sizei count, enum type,
         const void *indices );

behaves identically to DrawElementsOneInstance with the instance parameter set
to zero; the effect of calling

    DrawElements(mode, count, type, indices);

is equivalent to the command sequence:

    if (mode, count or type is invalid)
       generate appropriate error
    else
       DrawElementsOneInstance(mode, count, type, indices, 0);

   The command

      void DrawElementsInstanced( enum mode, sizei count,
         enum type, const void *indices, sizei primcount );

behaves identically to DrawElements except that primcount instances of the set of
elements are executed, the value of instanceID advances between each set, and the
instance advances between each set. It has the same effect as:

    if (mode, count, or type is invalid)
       generate appropriate error
    else {
       for (int i = 0; i < primcount; i++) {
           instanceID = i;

    }

   The command

    }

   The command

      void DrawRangeElements( enum mode, uint start,
         uint end, sizei count, enum type, const
         void *indices );

is a restricted form of DrawElements. mode, count, type, and indices match the
corresponding arguments to DrawElements, with the additional constraint that all
index values identified by indices must lie between start and end inclusive.
    Implementations denote recommended maximum amounts of vertex and index
data, which may be queried by calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constants
MAX_ELEMENTS_VERTICES and MAX_ELEMENTS_INDICES. If end − start + 1
is greater than the value of MAX_ELEMENTS_VERTICES, or if count is greater than
the value of MAX_ELEMENTS_INDICES, then the call may operate at reduced per-
formance. There is no requirement that all vertices in the range [start, end] be
referenced. However, the implementation may partially process unused vertices,
reducing performance from what could be achieved with an optimal index set.
    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if end < start. Invalid mode, count,
or type parameters generate the same errors as would the corresponding call to
DrawElements. It is an error for index values other than the primitive restart
index to lie outside the range [start, end], but implementations are not required to
check for this. Such indices will cause implementation-dependent behavior.
    The commands

      void DrawElementsBaseVertex( enum mode, sizei count,
        enum type, const void *indices, int basevertex );
      void DrawRangeElementsBaseVertex( enum mode,
        uint start, uint end, sizei count, enum type, const

are equivalent to the commands with the same base name (without the BaseVertex
suffix), except that the ith element transferred by the corresponding draw call will
be taken from element indices[i] + basevertex of each enabled array. If the result-
ing value is larger than the maximum value representable by type, it should behave
as if the calculation were upconverted to 32-bit unsigned integers (with wrapping
on overflow conditions). The operation is undefined if the sum would be negative
and should be handled as described in section 2.9.4. For DrawRangeElementsBa-
seVertex, the index values must lie between start and end inclusive, prior to adding
the basevertex offset. Index values lying outside the range [start, end] are treated
in the same way as DrawRangeElements.
    The command

       void MultiDrawElementsBaseVertex( enum mode, const
          sizei *count, enum type, const void **indices,
          sizei primcount, const int *basevertex );

behaves identically to DrawElementsBaseVertex, except that primcount separate
lists of elements are specified instead. It has the same effect as:

      for (int i = 0; i < primcount; i++)
         if (count[i] > 0)
            DrawElementsBaseVertex(mode, count[i], type,
               indices[i], basevertex[i]);


   If the number of supported generic vertex attributes (the value of MAX_-
VERTEX_ATTRIBS) is n, then the state required to implement vertex arrays con-
sists of n boolean values, n memory pointers, n integer stride values, n symbolic
constants representing array types, n integers representing values per element, n
boolean values indicating normalization, n boolean values indicating whether the
attribute values are pure integers, n integers representing vertex attribute divisors,
and an unsigned integer representing the restart index.
     In the initial state, the boolean values are each false, the memory pointers are
each NULL, the strides are each zero, the array types are each FLOAT, the integers
representing values per element are each four, the normalized and pure integer flags
are each false, the divisors are each zero, and the restart index is zero.


2.9     Buffer Objects
Vertex array data are stored in high-performance server memory. GL buffer ob-
jects provide a mechanism that clients can use to allocate, initialize, and render

from such memory.
   The command

        void GenBuffers( sizei n, uint *buffers );

returns n previously unused buffer object names in buffers. These names are
marked as used, for the purposes of GenBuffers only, but they acquire buffer state
only when they are first bound with BindBuffer (see below), just as if they were
unused.
    Buffer objects are deleted by calling

        void DeleteBuffers( sizei n, const uint *buffers );

buffers contains n names of buffer objects to be deleted. After a buffer object is
deleted it has no contents, and its name is again unused. Unused names in buffers
are silently ignored, as is the value zero.

2.9.1    Creating and Binding Buffer Objects
A buffer object is created by binding a name returned by GenBuffers to a buffer
target. The binding is effected by calling

        void BindBuffer( enum target, uint buffer );

target must be one of the targets listed in table 2.8. If the buffer object named buffer
has not been previously bound, the GL creates a new state vector, initialized with
a zero-sized memory buffer and comprising the state values listed in table 2.9.
    Buffer objects created by binding a name returned by GenBuffers to any of
the valid targets are formally equivalent, but the GL may make different choices
about storage location and layout based on the initial binding.
    BindBuffer may also be used to bind an existing buffer object. If the bind is
successful no change is made to the state of the newly bound buffer object, and any
previous binding to target is broken.
    BindBuffer fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if buffer is
not zero or a name returned from a previous call to GenBuffers, or if such a name
has since been deleted with DeleteBuffers.
    While a buffer object is bound, GL operations on the target to which it is bound
affect the bound buffer object, and queries of the target to which a buffer object is
bound return state from the bound object. Operations on the target also affect any
other bindings of that object.

    If a buffer object is deleted while it is bound, all bindings to that object in
the current context (i.e. in the thread that called DeleteBuffers) are reset to zero.
Bindings to that buffer in other contexts and other threads are not affected, but
attempting to use a deleted buffer in another thread produces undefined results,
including but not limited to possible GL errors and rendering corruption. Using
a deleted buffer in another context or thread may not, however, result in program
termination.
    Initially, each buffer object target is bound to zero. There is no buffer object
corresponding to the name zero, so client attempts to modify or query buffer object
state for a target bound to zero generate an INVALID_OPERATION error.

Binding Buffer Objects to Indexed Targets
Buffer objects may be bound to indexed targets by calling one of the commands

        void BindBufferRange( enum target, uint index,
           uint buffer, intptr offset, sizeiptr size );
        void BindBufferBase( enum target, uint index, uint buffer );

target must be TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER or UNIFORM_BUFFER. Addi-
tional language specific to each target is included in sections referred to for each
target in table 2.8.
     Each target represents an indexed array of buffer object binding points, as well
as a single general binding point that can be used by other buffer object manipu-
lation functions (e.g. BindBuffer, MapBuffer). Both commands bind the buffer
object named by buffer to both the general binding point, and to the binding point
in the array given by index. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is
greater than or equal to the number of target-specific indexed binding points.
     For BindBufferRange, offset specifies a starting offset into the buffer object
buffer, and size specifies the amount of data that can be read from the buffer object
while used as an indexed target. Both offset and size are in basic machine units.
The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if size is less than or equal to zero or if
offset + size is greater than the value of BUFFER_SIZE. Additional errors may be
generated if offset violates target-specific alignment requirements.
     BindBufferBase is equivalent to calling BindBufferRange with offset zero
and size equal to the size of buffer.

      void BufferData( enum target, sizeiptr size, const
         void *data, enum usage );

with target set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8, size set to the size of the data
store in basic machine units, and data pointing to the source data in client memory.
If data is non-null, then the source data is copied to the buffer object’s data store.
If data is null, then the contents of the buffer object’s data store are undefined.
    usage is specified as one of nine enumerated values, indicating the expected
application usage pattern of the data store. The values are:

STREAM_DRAW The data store contents will be specified once by the application,
      and used at most a few times as the source for GL drawing and image speci-
      fication commands.

STREAM_READ The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from
      the GL, and queried at most a few times by the application.

STREAM_COPY The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from
      the GL, and used at most a few times as the source for GL drawing and image
      specification commands.

STATIC_DRAW The data store contents will be specified once by the application,
      and used many times as the source for GL drawing and image specification
      commands.

STATIC_READ The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from
      the GL, and queried many times by the application.

STATIC_COPY The data store contents will be specified once by reading data from
      the GL, and used many times as the source for GL drawing and image spec-
      ification commands.

DYNAMIC_DRAW The data store contents will be respecified repeatedly by the ap-
      plication, and used many times as the source for GL drawing and image
      specification commands.

DYNAMIC_READ The data store contents will be respecified repeatedly by reading
      data from the GL, and queried many times by the application.

DYNAMIC_COPY The data store contents will be respecified repeatedly by reading
      data from the GL, and used many times as the source for GL drawing and

    usage is provided as a performance hint only. The specified usage value does
not constrain the actual usage pattern of the data store.
    BufferData deletes any existing data store, and sets the values of the buffer
object’s state variables as shown in table 2.10.
    Clients must align data elements consistent with the requirements of the client
platform, with an additional base-level requirement that an offset within a buffer to
a datum comprising N basic machine units be a multiple of N .
    If the GL is unable to create a data store of the requested size, the error OUT_-
OF_MEMORY is generated.
    To modify some or all of the data contained in a buffer object’s data store, the
client may use the command
        void BufferSubData( enum target, intptr offset,
           sizeiptr size, const void *data );
with target set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8. offset and size indicate the
range of data in the buffer object that is to be replaced, in terms of basic machine
units. data specifies a region of client memory size basic machine units in length,
containing the data that replace the specified buffer range. An INVALID_VALUE
error is generated if offset or size is less than zero or if offset + size is greater than
the value of BUFFER_SIZE. An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if any
part of the specified buffer range is mapped with MapBufferRange or MapBuffer
(see section 2.9.3).

2.9.3    Mapping and Unmapping Buffer Data
All or part of the data store of a buffer object may be mapped into the client’s
address space by calling

      void *MapBufferRange( enum target, intptr offset,
         sizeiptr length, bitfield access );
with target set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8. offset and length indicate the
range of data in the buffer object that is to be mapped, in terms of basic machine
units. access is a bitfield containing flags which describe the requested mapping.
These flags are described below.
    If no error occurs, a pointer to the beginning of the mapped range is returned
once all pending operations on that buffer have completed, and may be used to
modify and/or query the corresponding range of the buffer, according to the fol-
lowing flag bits set in access:
    • MAP_READ_BIT indicates that the returned pointer may be used to read
      buffer object data. No GL error is generated if the pointer is used to query
      a mapping which excludes this flag, but the result is undefined and system
      errors (possibly including program termination) may occur.
    • MAP_WRITE_BIT indicates that the returned pointer may be used to modify
      buffer object data. No GL error is generated if the pointer is used to modify
      a mapping which excludes this flag, but the result is undefined and system
      errors (possibly including program termination) may occur.
    Pointer values returned by MapBufferRange may not be passed as parameter
values to GL commands. For example, they may not be used to specify array
pointers, or to specify or query pixel or texture image data; such actions produce
undefined results, although implementations may not check for such behavior for
performance reasons.
    Mappings to the data stores of buffer objects may have nonstandard perfor-
mance characteristics. For example, such mappings may be marked as uncacheable
regions of memory, and in such cases reading from them may be very slow. To en-
sure optimal performance, the client should use the mapping in a fashion consistent
with the values of BUFFER_USAGE and access. Using a mapping in a fashion in-
consistent with these values is liable to be multiple orders of magnitude slower
than using normal memory.
    The following optional flag bits in access may be used to modify the mapping:
    • MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BIT indicates that the previous contents of the
      specified range may be discarded. Data within this range are undefined with
      the exception of subsequently written data. No GL error is generated if sub-
      sequent GL operations access unwritten data, but the result is undefined and
      system errors (possibly including program termination) may occur. This flag
      may not be used in combination with MAP_READ_BIT.

Table 2.11: Buffer object state set by MapBufferRange.
1BUFFER_ACCESS is set to READ_ONLY, WRITE_ONLY, or READ_WRITE if access
& (MAP_READ_BIT|MAP_WRITE_BIT) is respectively MAP_READ_BIT, MAP_-
WRITE_BIT, or MAP_READ_BIT|MAP_WRITE_BIT.



    • MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT indicates that the previous contents of the
      entire buffer may be discarded. Data within the entire buffer are undefined
      with the exception of subsequently written data. No GL error is generated if
      subsequent GL operations access unwritten data, but the result is undefined
      and system errors (possibly including program termination) may occur. This
      flag may not be used in combination with MAP_READ_BIT.

    • MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT indicates that one or more discrete subranges
      of the mapping may be modified. When this flag is set, modifications to
      each subrange must be explicitly flushed by calling FlushMappedBuffer-
      Range. No GL error is set if a subrange of the mapping is modified and
      not flushed, but data within the corresponding subrange of the buffer are un-
      defined. This flag may only be used in conjunction with MAP_WRITE_BIT.
      When this option is selected, flushing is strictly limited to regions that are
      explicitly indicated with calls to FlushMappedBufferRange prior to un-
      map; if this option is not selected UnmapBuffer will automatically flush the
      entire mapped range when called.

    • MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT indicates that the GL should not attempt to
      synchronize pending operations on the buffer prior to returning from Map-
      BufferRange. No GL error is generated if pending operations which source
      or modify the buffer overlap the mapped region, but the result of such previ-
      ous and any subsequent operations is undefined.

    A successful MapBufferRange sets buffer object state values as shown in ta-
ble 2.11.

Errors
    If an error occurs, MapBufferRange returns a NULL pointer.
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if offset or length is negative, if offset +
length is greater than the value of BUFFER_SIZE, or if access has any bits set other
than those defined above.
    An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated for any of the following condi-
tions:

   • The buffer is already in a mapped state.

   • Neither MAP_READ_BIT nor MAP_WRITE_BIT is set.

   • MAP_READ_BIT is set and any of MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BIT, MAP_-
     INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT, or MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT is set.

   • MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT is set and MAP_WRITE_BIT is not set.

    An OUT_OF_MEMORY error is generated if MapBufferRange fails because
memory for the mapping could not be obtained.
    No error is generated if memory outside the mapped range is modified or
queried, but the result is undefined and system errors (possibly including program
termination) may occur.
    The entire data store of a buffer object can be mapped into the client’s address
space by calling

      void *MapBuffer( enum target, enum access );

MapBuffer is equivalent to calling MapBufferRange with the same target, offset
of zero, length equal to the value of BUFFER_SIZE, and the access bitfield
value passed to MapBufferRange equal to

   • MAP_READ_BIT, if mbaccess is READ_ONLY

   • MAP_WRITE_BIT, if mbaccess is WRITE_ONLY

   • MAP_READ_BIT|MAP_WRITE_BIT, if mbaccess is READ_WRITE

and mbaccess is the value of the access enum parameter passed to MapBuffer.
    INVALID_ENUM is generated if access is not one of the values described above.
Other errors are generated as described above for MapBufferRange.
    If a buffer is mapped with the MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT flag, modifications
to the mapped range may be indicated by calling

2.9. BUFFER OBJECTS                                                              46


      void FlushMappedBufferRange( enum target, intptr offset,
         sizeiptr length );

with target set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8. offset and length indi-
cate a modified subrange of the mapping, in basic machine units. The specified
subrange to flush is relative to the start of the currently mapped range of buffer.
FlushMappedBufferRange may be called multiple times to indicate distinct sub-
ranges of the mapping which require flushing.

Errors
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if offset or length is negative, or if
offset + length exceeds the size of the mapping.
    An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if zero is bound to target.
    An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if the buffer bound to target is
not mapped, or is mapped without the MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT flag.

Unmapping Buffers
After the client has specified the contents of a mapped buffer range, and before the
data in that range are dereferenced by any GL commands, the mapping must be
relinquished by calling

      boolean UnmapBuffer( enum target );

with target set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8. Unmapping a mapped buffer
object invalidates the pointer to its data store and sets the object’s BUFFER_-
MAPPED, BUFFER_MAP_POINTER, BUFFER_ACCESS_FLAGS, BUFFER_MAP_-
OFFSET, and BUFFER_MAP_LENGTH state variables to the initial values shown in
table 2.10.
    UnmapBuffer returns TRUE unless data values in the buffer’s data store have
become corrupted during the period that the buffer was mapped. Such corruption
can be the result of a screen resolution change or other window system-dependent
event that causes system heaps such as those for high-performance graphics mem-
ory to be discarded. GL implementations must guarantee that such corruption can
occur only during the periods that a buffer’s data store is mapped. If such corrup-
tion has occurred, UnmapBuffer returns FALSE, and the contents of the buffer’s
data store become undefined.
    If the buffer data store is already in the unmapped state, UnmapBuffer returns
FALSE, and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated. However, unmapping
that occurs as a side effect of buffer deletion or reinitialization is not an error.

Effects of Mapping Buffers on Other GL Commands
Most, but not all GL commands will detect attempts to read data from a mapped
buffer object. When such an attempt is detected, an INVALID_OPERATION error
will be generated. Any command which does not detect these attempts, and per-
forms such an invalid read, has undefined results and may result in GL interruption
or termination.

2.9.4    Effects of Accessing Outside Buffer Bounds
Most, but not all GL commands operating on buffer objects will detect attempts to
read from or write to a location in a bound buffer object at an offset less than zero,
or greater than or equal to the buffer’s size. When such an attempt is detected, a
GL error will be generated. Any command which does not detect these attempts,
and performs such an invalid read or write, has undefined results, and may result
in GL interruption or termination.

2.9.5    Copying Between Buffers
All or part of the data store of a buffer object may be copied to the data store of
another buffer object by calling

        void *CopyBufferSubData( enum readtarget,
           enum writetarget, intptr readoffset, intptr writeoffset,
           sizeiptr size );

with readtarget and writetarget each set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8.
While any of these targets may be used, the COPY_READ_BUFFER and COPY_-
WRITE_BUFFER targets are provided specifically for copies, so that they can be
done without affecting other buffer binding targets that may be in use. writeoffset
and size specify the range of data in the buffer object bound to writetarget that is
to be replaced, in terms of basic machine units. readoffset and size specify the
range of data in the buffer object bound to readtarget that is to be copied to the
corresponding region of writetarget.
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if any of readoffset, writeoffset, or size
are negative, if readoffset + size exceeds the size of the buffer object bound to
readtarget, or if writeoffset + size exceeds the size of the buffer object bound to
writetarget.
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if the same buffer object is bound to
both readtarget and writetarget, and the ranges [readoffset, readoffset + size) and
[writeoffset, writeoffset + size) overlap.

    An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if zero is bound to readtarget or
writetarget.
    An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if the buffer objects bound to
either readtarget or writetarget are mapped.

2.9.6   Vertex Arrays in Buffer Objects
Blocks of vertex array data are stored in buffer objects with the same format and
layout options described in section 2.8. A buffer object binding point is added to
the client state associated with each vertex array type. The commands that specify
the locations and organizations of vertex arrays copy the buffer object name that is
bound to ARRAY_BUFFER to the binding point corresponding to the vertex array of
the type being specified. For example, the VertexAttribPointer command copies
the value of ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING (the queriable name of the buffer binding
corresponding to the target ARRAY_BUFFER) to the client state variable VERTEX_-
ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING for the specified index.
    Rendering commands DrawArrays, and the other drawing commands defined
in section 2.8.3 operate as previously defined, where data for enabled generic at-
tribute arrays are sourced from buffer objects. When an array is sourced from a
buffer object, the pointer value of that array is used to compute an offset, in basic
machine units, into the data store of the buffer object. This offset is computed by
subtracting a null pointer from the pointer value, where both pointers are treated as
pointers to basic machine units.
    If any enabled array’s buffer binding is zero when DrawArrays or one of the
other drawing commands defined in section 2.8.3 is called, the result is undefined.

2.9.7   Array Indices in Buffer Objects
Blocks of array indices are stored in buffer objects in the formats described by the
type parameter of DrawElements (see section 2.8.3).
    A buffer object is bound to ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER by calling BindBuffer
with target set to ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, and buffer set to the name of the
buffer object. If no corresponding buffer object exists, one is initialized as defined
in section 2.9.
    DrawElements, DrawRangeElements, and DrawElementsInstanced source
their indices from the buffer object whose name is bound to ELEMENT_-
ARRAY_BUFFER, using their indices parameters as offsets into the buffer ob-
ject in the same fashion as described in section 2.9.6. DrawElementsBaseV-
ertex, DrawRangeElementsBaseVertex, and DrawElementsInstancedBaseVer-
tex also source their indices from that buffer object, adding the basevertex offset to

2.10. VERTEX ARRAY OBJECTS                                                           49


the appropriate vertex index as a final step before indexing into the vertex buffer;
this does not affect the calculation of the base pointer for the index array. Finally,
MultiDrawElements and MultiDrawElementsBaseVertex also source their in-
dices from that buffer object, using its indices parameter as a pointer to an ar-
ray of pointers that represent offsets into the buffer object. If zero is bound to
ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, the result of these drawing commands is undefined.
    In some cases performance will be optimized by storing indices and array data
in separate buffer objects, and by creating those buffer objects with the correspond-
ing binding points.

2.9.8    Buffer Object State
The state required to support buffer objects consists of binding names for each
of the buffer targets in table 2.8, and for each of the indexed buffer targets in sec-
tion 2.9.1. Additionally, each vertex array has an associated binding so there is a
buffer object binding for each of the vertex attribute arrays. The initial values for
all buffer object bindings is zero.
     The state of each buffer object consists of a buffer size in basic machine units, a
usage parameter, an access parameter, a mapped boolean, two integers for the offset
and size of the mapped region, a pointer to the mapped buffer (NULL if unmapped),
and the sized array of basic machine units for the buffer data.


2.10      Vertex Array Objects
The buffer objects that are to be used by the vertex stage of the GL are collected
together to form a vertex array object. All state related to the definition of data
used by the vertex processor is encapsulated in a vertex array object.
    The command

        void GenVertexArrays( sizei n, uint *arrays );

returns n previous unused vertex array object names in arrays. These names are
marked as used, for the purposes of GenVertexArrays only, but they acquire array
state only when they are first bound.
    Vertex array objects are deleted by calling

        void DeleteVertexArrays( sizei n, const uint *arrays );

arrays contains n names of vertex array objects to be deleted. Once a vertex array
object is deleted it has no contents and its name is again unused. If a vertex array

object that is currently bound is deleted, the binding for that object reverts to zero
and the default vertex array becomes current. Unused names in arrays are silently
ignored, as is the value zero.
    A vertex array object is created by binding a name returned by GenVertexAr-
rays with the command

       void BindVertexArray( uint array );

array is the vertex array object name. The resulting vertex array object is a new
state vector, comprising all the state values listed in tables 6.4 and 6.5.
     BindVertexArray may also be used to bind an existing vertex array object.
If the bind is successful no change is made to the state of the bound vertex array
object, and any previous binding is broken.
     The currently bound vertex array object is used for all commands which modify
vertex array state, such as VertexAttribPointer and EnableVertexAttribArray;
all commands which draw from vertex arrays, such as DrawArrays and DrawEle-
ments; and all queries of vertex array state (see chapter 6).
     BindVertexArray fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if ar-
ray is not zero or a name returned from a previous call to GenVertexArrays, or if
such a name has since been deleted with DeleteVertexArrays.


2.11     Vertex Shaders
Vertex shaders describe the operations that occur on vertex values and their asso-
ciated data.
    A vertex shader is an array of strings containing source code for the operations
that are meant to occur on each vertex that is processed. The language used for
vertex shaders is described in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
    To use a vertex shader, shader source code is first loaded into a shader ob-
ject and then compiled. One or more vertex shader objects are then attached to
a program object. A program object is then linked, which generates executable
code from all the compiled shader objects attached to the program. When a linked
program object is used as the current program object, the executable code for the
vertex shaders it contains is used to process vertices.
    In addition to vertex shaders, geometry shaders and fragment shaders can be
created, compiled, and linked into program objects. Geometry shaders affect the
processing of primitives assembled from vertices (see section 2.12). Fragment
shaders affect the processing of fragments during rasterization (see section 3.9). A
single program object can contain all of vertex, geometry, and fragment shaders.

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                               51


    When the program object currently in use includes a vertex shader, its vertex
shader is considered active and is used to process vertices. If the program object
has no vertex shader, or no program object is currently in use, the results of vertex
shader execution are undefined.
    A vertex shader can reference a number of variables as it executes. Vertex
attributes are the per-vertex values specified in section 2.7. Uniforms are per-
program variables that are constant during program execution. Samplers are a
special form of uniform used for texturing (section 3.8). Varying variables hold
the results of vertex shader execution that are used later in the pipeline. Each of
these variable types is described in more detail below.

2.11.1    Shader Objects
The source code that makes up a program that gets executed by one of the pro-
grammable stages is encapsulated in one or more shader objects.
     The name space for shader objects is the unsigned integers, with zero reserved
for the GL. This name space is shared with program objects. The following sections
define commands that operate on shader and program objects by name. Commands
that accept shader or program object names will generate the error INVALID_-
VALUE if the provided name is not the name of either a shader or program object
and INVALID_OPERATION if the provided name identifies an object that is not the
expected type.
     To create a shader object, use the command

      uint CreateShader( enum type );

The shader object is empty when it is created. The type argument specifies the type
of shader object to be created. For vertex shaders, type must be VERTEX_SHADER.
A non-zero name that can be used to reference the shader object is returned. If an
error occurs, zero will be returned.
    The command

      void ShaderSource( uint shader, sizei count, const
         char **string, const int *length );

loads source code into the shader object named shader. string is an array of count
pointers to optionally null-terminated character strings that make up the source
code. The length argument is an array with the number of chars in each string (the
string length). If an element in length is negative, its accompanying string is null-
terminated. If length is NULL, all strings in the string argument are considered null-
terminated. The ShaderSource command sets the source code for the shader to

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                                     52


the text strings in the string array. If shader previously had source code loaded into
it, the existing source code is completely replaced. Any length passed in excludes
the null terminator in its count.
     The strings that are loaded into a shader object are expected to form the source
code for a valid shader as defined in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
     Once the source code for a shader has been loaded, a shader object can be
compiled with the command

      void CompileShader( uint shader );

Each shader object has a boolean status, COMPILE_STATUS, that is modified as
a result of compilation. This status can be queried with GetShaderiv (see sec-
tion 6.1.11). This status will be set to TRUE if shader was compiled without errors
and is ready for use, and FALSE otherwise. Compilation can fail for a variety of
reasons as listed in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. If Compile-
Shader failed, any information about a previous compile is lost. Thus a failed
compile does not restore the old state of shader.
    Changing the source code of a shader object with ShaderSource does not
change its compile status or the compiled shader code.
    Each shader object has an information log, which is a text string that is over-
written as a result of compilation. This information log can be queried with Get-
ShaderInfoLog to obtain more information about the compilation attempt (see
section 6.1.11).
    An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if shader is not the name of a
valid shader object generated by CreateShader.
    Shader objects can be deleted with the command

      void DeleteShader( uint shader );

If shader is not attached to any program object, it is deleted immediately. Oth-
erwise, shader is flagged for deletion and will be deleted when it is no longer
attached to any program object. If an object is flagged for deletion, its boolean
status bit DELETE_STATUS is set to true. The value of DELETE_STATUS can be
queried with GetShaderiv (see section 6.1.11). DeleteShader will silently ignore
the value zero.

2.11.2    Program Objects
The shader objects that are to be used by the programmable stages of the GL are
collected together to form a program object. The programs that are executed by
these programmable stages are called executables. All information necessary for

defining an executable is encapsulated in a program object. A program object is
created with the command

      uint CreateProgram( void );

Program objects are empty when they are created. A non-zero name that can be
used to reference the program object is returned. If an error occurs, zero will be
returned.
    To attach a shader object to a program object, use the command

      void AttachShader( uint program, uint shader );

The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is already attached to pro-
gram.
    Shader objects may be attached to program objects before source code has
been loaded into the shader object, or before the shader object has been compiled.
Multiple shader objects of the same type may be attached to a single program
object, and a single shader object may be attached to more than one program object.
    To detach a shader object from a program object, use the command

      void DetachShader( uint program, uint shader );

The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not attached to program.
If shader has been flagged for deletion and is not attached to any other program
object, it is deleted.
    In order to use the shader objects contained in a program object, the program
object must be linked. The command

      void LinkProgram( uint program );

will link the program object named program. Each program object has a boolean
status, LINK_STATUS, that is modified as a result of linking. This status can be
queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.11). This status will be set to TRUE if
a valid executable is created, and FALSE otherwise. Linking can fail for a variety
of reasons as specified in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. Linking
will also fail if one or more of the shader objects, attached to program are not
compiled successfully, or if more active uniform or active sampler variables are
used in program than allowed (see sections 2.11.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.3).
    Linking will also fail if the program object contains objects to form a geometry
shader (see section 2.12), and

   • the program contains no objects to form a vertex shader;

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                                54


   • the input primitive type, output primitive type, or maximum output vertex
     count is not specified in any compiled geometry shader object; or

   • the input primitive type, output primitive type, or maximum output vertex
     count is specified differently in multiple geometry shader objects.

    If LinkProgram failed, any information about a previous link of that program
object is lost. Thus, a failed link does not restore the old state of program.
    Each program object has an information log that is overwritten as a result of a
link operation. This information log can be queried with GetProgramInfoLog to
obtain more information about the link operation or the validation information (see
section 6.1.11).
    If a valid executable is created, it can be made part of the current rendering
state with the command

      void UseProgram( uint program );

This command will install the executable code as part of current rendering state if
the program object program contains valid executable code, i.e. has been linked
successfully. If UseProgram is called with program set to 0, then the current
rendering state refers to an invalid program object, and the results of vertex and
fragment shader execution are undefined. However, this is not an error. If program
has not been successfully linked, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated and
the current rendering state is not modified.
    While a program object is in use, applications are free to modify attached
shader objects, compile attached shader objects, attach additional shader objects,
and detach shader objects. These operations do not affect the link status or exe-
cutable code of the program object.
    If the program object that is in use is re-linked successfully, the LinkProgram
command will install the generated executable code as part of the current rendering
state if the specified program object was already in use as a result of a previous call
to UseProgram.
    If that program object that is in use is re-linked unsuccessfully, the link status
will be set to FALSE, but existing executable and associated state will remain part
of the current rendering state until a subsequent call to UseProgram removes it
from use. After such a program is removed from use, it can not be made part of the
current rendering state until it is successfully re-linked.
    Program objects can be deleted with the command

      void DeleteProgram( uint program );

If program is not the current program for any GL context, it is deleted immediately.
Otherwise, program is flagged for deletion and will be deleted when it is no longer
the current program for any context. When a program object is deleted, all shader
objects attached to it are detached. DeleteProgram will silently ignore the value
zero.

2.11.3    Vertex Attributes
Vertex shaders can define named attribute variables, which are bound to the generic
vertex attributes that are set by VertexAttrib*. This binding can be specified by
the application before the program is linked, or automatically assigned by the GL
when the program is linked.
     When an attribute variable declared as a float, vec2, vec3 or vec4 is bound
to a generic attribute index i, its value(s) are taken from the x, (x, y), (x, y, z), or
(x, y, z, w) components, respectively, of the generic attribute i. When an attribute
variable is declared as a mat2, mat3x2 or mat4x2, its matrix columns are taken
from the (x, y) components of generic attributes i and i + 1 (mat2), from attributes
i through i + 2 (mat3x2), or from attributes i through i + 3 (mat4x2). When an
attribute variable is declared as a mat2x3, mat3 or mat4x3, its matrix columns
are taken from the (x, y, z) components of generic attributes i and i + 1 (mat2x3),
from attributes i through i + 2 (mat3), or from attributes i through i + 3 (mat4x3).
When an attribute variable is declared as a mat2x4, mat3x4 or mat4, its matrix
columns are taken from the (x, y, z, w) components of generic attributes i and i+1
(mat2x4), from attributes i through i + 2 (mat3x4), or from attributes i through
i + 3 (mat4).
     A generic attribute variable is considered active if it is determined by the com-
piler and linker that the attribute may be accessed when the shader is executed. At-
tribute variables that are declared in a vertex shader but never used will not count
against the limit. In cases where the compiler and linker cannot make a conclusive
determination, an attribute will be considered active. A program object will fail to
link if the number of active vertex attributes exceeds MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.
     To determine the set of active vertex attributes used by a program, and to de-
termine their types, use the command:

      void GetActiveAttrib( uint program, uint index,
         sizei bufSize, sizei *length, int *size, enum *type,
         char *name );

This command provides information about the attribute selected by index. An in-
dex of 0 selects the first active attribute, and an index of ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES − 1

selects the last active attribute. The value of ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES can be queried
with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.11). If index is greater than or equal to
ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated. Note that index
simply identifies a member in a list of active attributes, and has no relation to the
generic attribute that the corresponding variable is bound to.
     The parameter program is the name of a program object for which the com-
mand LinkProgram has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to
have been linked successfully. The link could have failed because the number of
active attributes exceeded the limit.
     The name of the selected attribute is returned as a null-terminated string in
name. The actual number of characters written into name, excluding the null termi-
nator, is returned in length. If length is NULL, no length is returned. The maximum
number of characters that may be written into name, including the null termina-
tor, is specified by bufSize. The returned attribute name must be the name of a
generic attribute. The length of the longest attribute name in program is given by
ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTE_MAX_LENGTH, which can be queried with GetProgramiv
(see section 6.1.11).
     For the selected attribute, the type of the attribute is returned into type.
The size of the attribute is returned into size. The value in size is in units of
the type returned in type. The type returned can be any of FLOAT, FLOAT_-
VEC2, FLOAT_VEC3, FLOAT_VEC4, FLOAT_MAT2, FLOAT_MAT3, FLOAT_MAT4,
FLOAT_MAT2x3, FLOAT_MAT2x4, FLOAT_MAT3x2, FLOAT_MAT3x4, FLOAT_-
MAT4x2, FLOAT_MAT4x3, INT, INT_VEC2, INT_VEC3, INT_VEC4, UNSIGNED_-
INT, UNSIGNED_INT_VEC2, UNSIGNED_INT_VEC3, or UNSIGNED_INT_VEC4.
     If an error occurred, the return parameters length, size, type and name will be
unmodified.
     This command will return as much information about active attributes as pos-
sible. If no information is available, length will be set to zero and name will be an
empty string. This situation could arise if GetActiveAttrib is issued after a failed
link.
     After a program object has been linked successfully, the bindings of attribute
variable names to indices can be queried. The command
      int GetAttribLocation( uint program, const char *name );
returns the generic attribute index that the attribute variable named name was bound
to when the program object named program was last linked. name must be a null-
terminated string. If name is active and is an attribute matrix, GetAttribLocation
returns the index of the first column of that matrix. If program has not been suc-
cessfully linked, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated. If name is not an
active attribute, or if an error occurs, -1 will be returned.

   The binding of an attribute variable to a generic attribute index can also be
specified explicitly. The command

      void BindAttribLocation( uint program, uint index, const
         char *name );

specifies that the attribute variable named name in program program should be
bound to generic vertex attribute index when the program is next linked. If name
was bound previously, its assigned binding is replaced with index. name must be a
null-terminated string. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is equal or
greater than MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS. BindAttribLocation has no effect until the
program is linked. In particular, it doesn’t modify the bindings of active attribute
variables in a program that has already been linked.
     When a program is linked, any active attributes without a binding specified ei-
ther through BindAttribLocation or explicitly set within the shader text will au-
tomatically be bound to vertex attributes by the GL. Such bindings can be queried
using the command GetAttribLocation. LinkProgram will fail if the assigned
binding of an active attribute variable would cause the GL to reference a non-
existent generic attribute (one greater than or equal to the value of MAX_VERTEX_-
ATTRIBS). LinkProgram will fail if the attribute bindings assigned by BindAttri-
bLocation do not leave not enough space to assign a location for an active matrix
attribute or an active attribute array, both of which require multiple contiguous
generic attributes. If an active attribute has a binding explicitly set within the shader
text and a different binding assigned by BindAttribLocation, the assignment in
the shader text is used.
     BindAttribLocation may be issued before any vertex shader objects are at-
tached to a program object. Hence it is allowed to bind any name to an index,
including a name that is never used as an attribute in any vertex shader object. As-
signed bindings for attribute variables that do not exist or are not active are ignored.
     The values of generic attributes sent to generic attribute index i are part of
current state. If a new program object has been made active, then these values
will be tracked by the GL in such a way that the same values will be observed by
attributes in the new program object that are also bound to index i.
     It is possible for an application to bind more than one attribute name to the
same location. This is referred to as aliasing. This will only work if only one of
the aliased attributes is active in the executable program, or if no path through the
shader consumes more than one attribute of a set of attributes aliased to the same
location. A link error can occur if the linker determines that every path through the
shader consumes multiple aliased attributes, but implementations are not required
to generate an error in this case. The compiler and linker are allowed to assume that

no aliasing is done, and may employ optimizations that work only in the absence
of aliasing.

2.11.4    Uniform Variables
Shaders can declare named uniform variables, as described in the OpenGL Shading
Language Specification. Values for these uniforms are constant over a primitive,
and typically they are constant across many primitives. Uniforms are program
object-specific state. They retain their values once loaded, and their values are
restored whenever a program object is used, as long as the program object has not
been re-linked. A uniform is considered active if it is determined by the compiler
and linker that the uniform will actually be accessed when the executable code
is executed. In cases where the compiler and linker cannot make a conclusive
determination, the uniform will be considered active.
    Sets of uniforms can be grouped into uniform blocks. The values of each uni-
form in such a set are extracted from the data store of a buffer object corresponding
to the uniform block. OpenGL Shading Language syntax serves to delimit named
blocks of uniforms that can be backed by a buffer object. These are referred to
as named uniform blocks, and are assigned a uniform block index. Uniforms that
are declared outside of a named uniform block are said to be part of the default
uniform block. Default uniform blocks have no name or uniform block index. Like
uniforms, uniform blocks can be active or inactive. Active uniform blocks are those
that contain active uniforms after a program has been compiled and linked.
    The amount of storage available for uniform variables in the default uniform
block accessed by a vertex shader is specified by the value of the implementation-
dependent constant MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS. The total amount of
combined storage available for uniform variables in all uniform blocks accessed
by a vertex shader (including the default uniform block) is specified by the value
of the implementation-dependent constant MAX_COMBINED_VERTEX_UNIFORM_-
COMPONENTS. These values represent the numbers of individual floating-point, in-
teger, or boolean values that can be held in uniform variable storage for a vertex
shader. A link error is generated if an attempt is made to utilize more than the space
available for vertex shader uniform variables.
    When a program is successfully linked, all active uniforms belonging to the
program object’s default uniform block are initialized as defined by the version of
the OpenGL Shading Language used to compile the program. A successful link
will also generate a location for each active uniform in the default uniform block.
The values of active uniforms in the default uniform block can be changed using
this location and the appropriate Uniform* command (see below). These locations
are invalidated and new ones assigned after each successful re-link.


                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                             59


    Similarly, when a program is successfully linked, all active uniforms belong-
ing to the program’s named uniform blocks are assigned offsets (and strides for
array and matrix type uniforms) within the uniform block according to layout rules
described below. Uniform buffer objects provide the storage for named uniform
blocks, so the values of active uniforms in named uniform blocks may be changed
by modifying the contents of the buffer object using commands such as Buffer-
Data, BufferSubData, MapBuffer, and UnmapBuffer. Uniforms in a named
uniform block are not assigned a location and may not be modified using the
Uniform* commands. The offsets and strides of all active uniforms belonging to
named uniform blocks of a program object are invalidated and new ones assigned
after each successful re-link.
    To find the location within a program object of an active uniform variable as-
sociated with the default uniform block, use the command

      int GetUniformLocation( uint program, const
         char *name );

    This command will return the location of uniform variable name if it is associ-
ated with the default uniform block. name must be a null-terminated string, without
white space. The value -1 will be returned if if name does not correspond to an
active uniform variable name in program, or if name is associated with a named
uniform block.
    If program has not been successfully linked, the error INVALID_OPERATION
is generated. After a program is linked, the location of a uniform variable will not
change, unless the program is re-linked.
    A valid name cannot be a structure, an array of structures, or any portion of
a single vector or a matrix. In order to identify a valid name, the "." (dot) and
"[]" operators can be used in name to specify a member of a structure or element
of an array.
    The first element of a uniform array is identified using the name of the uniform
array appended with "[0]". Except if the last part of the string name indicates a
uniform array, then the location of the first element of that array can be retrieved
by either using the name of the uniform array, or the name of the uniform array
appended with "[0]".
    Named uniform blocks, like uniforms, are identified by name strings. Uniform
block indices corresponding to uniform block names can be queried by calling

      uint GetUniformBlockIndex( uint program, const
         char *uniformBlockName );

program is the name of a program object for which the command LinkProgram
has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to have been linked
successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms
exceeded the limit.
    uniformBlockName must contain a null-terminated string specifying the name
of a uniform block.
    GetUniformBlockIndex returns the uniform block index for the uniform block
named uniformBlockName of program. If uniformBlockName does not identify an
active uniform block of program, or an error occurred, then INVALID_INDEX is
returned. The indices of the active uniform blocks of a program are assigned in
consecutive order, beginning with zero.
    An active uniform block’s name string can be queried from its uniform block
index by calling

      void GetActiveUniformBlockName( uint program,
         uint uniformBlockIndex, sizei bufSize, sizei *length,
         char *uniformBlockName );

program is the name of a program object for which the command LinkProgram
has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to have been linked
successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms
exceeded the limit.
    uniformBlockIndex must be an active uniform block index of program, in the
range zero to the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS - 1. The value of ACTIVE_-
UNIFORM_BLOCKS can be queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.11). If
uniformBlockIndex is greater than or equal to the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORM_-
BLOCKS, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.
    The string name of the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex is re-
turned into uniformBlockName. The name is null-terminated. The actual number
of characters written into uniformBlockName, excluding the null terminator, is re-
turned in length. If length is NULL, no length is returned.
    bufSize contains the maximum number of characters (including the null termi-
nator) that will be written back to uniformBlockName.
    If an error occurs, nothing will be written to uniformBlockName or length.
    Information about an active uniform block can be queried by calling

      void GetActiveUniformBlockiv( uint program,

successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms
exceeded the limit.
     uniformBlockIndex is an active uniform block index of program. If uniform-
BlockIndex is greater than or equal to the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS, or
is not the index of an active uniform block in program, the error INVALID_VALUE
is generated.
     If no error occurs, the uniform block parameter(s) specified by pname are re-
turned in params. Otherwise, nothing will be written to params.
     If pname is UNIFORM_BLOCK_BINDING, then the index of the uniform buffer
binding point last selected by the uniform block specified by uniformBlockIndex
for program is returned. If no uniform block has been previously specified, zero is
returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE, then the implementation-
dependent minimum total buffer object size, in basic machine units, required to
hold all active uniforms in the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex is
returned. It is neither guaranteed nor expected that a given implementation will
arrange uniform values as tightly packed in a buffer object. The exception to this
is the std140 uniform block layout, which guarantees specific packing behavior
and does not require the application to query for offsets and strides. In this case the
minimum size may still be queried, even though it is determined in advance based
only on the uniform block declaration (see “Standard Uniform Block Layout” in
section 2.11.4).
     The total amount of buffer object storage available for any given uniform block
is subject to an implementation-dependent limit. The maximum amount of avail-
able space, in basic machine units, can be queried by calling GetIntegerv with
the constant MAX_UNIFORM_BLOCK_SIZE. If the amount of storage required for a
uniform block exceeds this limit, a program may fail to link.
     If pname is UNIFORM_BLOCK_NAME_LENGTH, then the total length (includ-
ing the null terminator) of the name of the uniform block identified by uniform-
BlockIndex is returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_BLOCK_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS, then the number of active
uniforms in the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex is returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_BLOCK_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_INDICES, then a list of the
active uniform indices for the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex is
returned. The number of elements that will be written to params is the value of
UNIFORM_BLOCK_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS for uniformBlockIndex.
     If          pname           is         UNIFORM_BLOCK_REFERENCED_BY_-

enced by the vertex, geometry, or fragment programming stages of program, re-
spectively, is returned.
     Each active uniform, whether in a named uniform block or in the default block,
is assigned an index when a program is linked. Indices are assigned in consecutive
order, beginning with zero. The indices assigned to a set of uniforms in a program
may be queried by calling

      void GetUniformIndices( uint program,
         sizei uniformCount, const char **uniformNames,
         uint *uniformIndices );

program is the name of a program object for which the command LinkProgram
has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to have been linked
successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms
exceeded the limit.
    uniformCount indicates both the number of elements in the array of names
uniformNames and the number of indices that may be written to uniformIndices.
    uniformNames contains a list of uniformCount name strings identifying the uni-
form names to be queried for indices. For each name string in uniformNames, the
index assigned to the active uniform of that name will be written to the correspond-
ing element of uniformIndices. If a string in uniformNames is not the name of an
active uniform, the value INVALID_INDEX will be written to the corresponding
element of uniformIndices.
    If an error occurs, nothing is written to uniformIndices.
    The name of an active uniform may be queried from the corresponding uniform
index by calling

      void GetActiveUniformName( uint program,
         uint uniformIndex, sizei bufSize, sizei *length,
         char *uniformName );

program is the name of a program object for which the command LinkProgram
has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to have been linked

    uniformIndex must be an active uniform index of the program program, in
the range zero to the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORMS - 1. The value of ACTIVE_-
UNIFORMS can be queried with GetProgramiv. If uniformIndex is greater than or
equal to the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORMS, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.
    The name of the uniform identified by uniformIndex is returned as a null-
terminated string in uniformName. The actual number of characters written into

uniformName, excluding the null terminator, is returned in length. If length is
NULL, no length is returned. The maximum number of characters that may be writ-
ten into uniformName, including the null terminator, is specified by bufSize. The
returned uniform name can be the name of built-in uniform state as well. The com-
plete list of built-in uniform state is described in section 7.5 of the OpenGL Shad-
ing Language Specification. The length of the longest uniform name in program
is given by the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH, which can be queried
with GetProgramiv.
     If GetActiveUniformName is not successful, nothing is written to length or
uniformName.
     Each uniform variable, declared in a shader, is broken down into one or more
strings using the "." (dot) and "[]" operators, if necessary, to the point that it is
legal to pass each string back into GetUniformLocation, for default uniform block
uniform names, or GetUniformIndices, for named uniform block uniform names.
     Information about active uniforms can be obtained by calling either

         void GetActiveUniform( uint program, uint index,
            sizei bufSize, sizei *length, int *size, enum *type,
            char *name );

         void GetActiveUniformsiv( uint program,
            sizei uniformCount, const uint *uniformIndices,
            enum pname, int *params );

program is the name of a program object for which the command LinkProgram
has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for program to have been linked
successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms
exceeded the limit.
     These commands provide information about the uniform or uniforms selected
by index or uniformIndices, respectively. In GetActiveUniform, an index of 0
selects the first active uniform, and an index of the value of ACTIVE_UNIFORMS
- 1 selects the last active uniform. In GetActiveUniformsiv, uniformIndices is an
array of such active uniform indices. If any index is greater than or equal to the
value of ACTIVE_UNIFORMS, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.
     For the selected uniform, GetActiveUniform returns the uniform name as a
null-terminated string in name. The actual number of characters written into name,
excluding the null terminator, is returned in length. If length is NULL, no length
is returned. The maximum number of characters that may be written into name,

including the null terminator, is specified by bufSize. The returned uniform name
can be the name of built-in uniform state as well. The complete list of built-in
uniform state is described in section 7.5 of the OpenGL Shading Language Speci-
fication. The length of the longest uniform name in program is given by ACTIVE_-
UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH.
     Each uniform variable, declared in a shader, is broken down into one or more
strings using the "." (dot) and "[]" operators, if necessary, to the point that it is
legal to pass each string back into GetUniformLocation, for default uniform block
uniform names, or GetUniformIndices, for named uniform block uniform names.
     For the selected uniform, GetActiveUniform returns the type of the uniform
into type and the size of the uniform is into size. The value in size is in units of the
uniform type, which can be any of the type name tokens in table 2.12, correspond-
ing to OpenGL Shading Language type keywords also shown in that table.
     If one or more elements of an array are active, GetActiveUniform will return
the name of the array in name, subject to the restrictions listed above. The type of
the array is returned in type. The size parameter contains the highest array element
index used, plus one. The compiler or linker determines the highest index used.
There will be only one active uniform reported by the GL per uniform array.
     GetActiveUniform will return as much information about active uniforms as
possible. If no information is available, length will be set to zero and name will be
an empty string. This situation could arise if GetActiveUniform is issued after a
failed link.
     If an error occurs, nothing is written to length, size, type, or name.

       GetActiveUniform and GetActiveUniformsiv, and correspond-
       ing shading language keywords declaring each such type.




    For GetActiveUniformsiv, uniformCount indicates both the number of ele-
ments in the array of indices uniformIndices and the number of parameters written
to params upon successful return. pname identifies a property of each uniform in
uniformIndices that should be written into the corresponding element of params.
If an error occurs, nothing will be written to params.
    If pname is UNIFORM_TYPE, then an array identifying the types of the uniforms
specified by the corresponding array of uniformIndices is returned. The returned

types can be any of the values in table 2.12.
     If pname is UNIFORM_SIZE, then an array identifying the size of the uniforms
specified by the corresponding array of uniformIndices is returned. The sizes re-
turned are in units of the type returned by a query of UNIFORM_TYPE. For active
uniforms that are arrays, the size is the number of active elements in the array; for
all other uniforms, the size is one.
     If pname is UNIFORM_NAME_LENGTH, then an array identifying the length,
including the terminating null character, of the uniform name strings specified by
the corresponding array of uniformIndices is returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_BLOCK_INDEX, then an array identifying the uniform
block index of each of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array of unifor-
mIndices is returned. The index of a uniform associated with the default uniform
block is -1.
     If pname is UNIFORM_OFFSET, then an array of uniform buffer offsets is re-
turned. For uniforms in a named uniform block, the returned value will be its offset,
in basic machine units, relative to the beginning of the uniform block in the buffer
object data store. For uniforms in the default uniform block, -1 will be returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_ARRAY_STRIDE, then an array identifying the stride
between elements, in basic machine units, of each of the uniforms specified by
the corresponding array of uniformIndices is returned. The stride of a uniform
associated with the default uniform block is -1. Note that this information only
makes sense for uniforms that are arrays. For uniforms that are not arrays, but are
declared in a named uniform block, an array stride of zero is returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_MATRIX_STRIDE, then an array identifying the stride
between columns of a column-major matrix or rows of a row-major matrix, in ba-
sic machine units, of each of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array of
uniformIndices is returned. The matrix stride of a uniform associated with the de-
fault uniform block is -1. Note that this information only makes sense for uniforms
that are matrices. For uniforms that are not matrices, but are declared in a named
uniform block, a matrix stride of zero is returned.
     If pname is UNIFORM_IS_ROW_MAJOR, then an array identifying whether each
of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array of uniformIndices is a row-
major matrix or not is returned. A value of one indicates a row-major matrix, and
a value of zero indicates a column-major matrix, a matrix in the default uniform
block, or a non-matrix.

Loading Uniform Variables In The Default Uniform Block
To load values into the uniform variables of the default uniform block of the pro-
gram object that is currently in use, use the commands


                       OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                                68


      void Uniform{1234}{if}( int location, T value );
      void Uniform{1234}{if}v( int location, sizei count, const
         T value );
      void Uniform{1234}ui( int location, T value );
      void Uniform{1234}uiv( int location, sizei count, const
         T value );
      void UniformMatrix{234}fv( int location, sizei count,
         boolean transpose, const float *value );
      void UniformMatrix{2x3,3x2,2x4,4x2,3x4,4x3}fv(
         int location, sizei count, boolean transpose, const
         float *value );

The given values are loaded into the default uniform block uniform variable loca-
tion identified by location.
    The Uniform*f{v} commands will load count sets of one to four floating-point
values into a uniform location defined as a float, a floating-point vector, an array of
floats, or an array of floating-point vectors.
    The Uniform*i{v} commands will load count sets of one to four integer val-
ues into a uniform location defined as a sampler, an integer, an integer vector, an
array of samplers, an array of integers, or an array of integer vectors. Only the
Uniform1i{v} commands can be used to load sampler values (see below).
    The Uniform*ui{v} commands will load count sets of one to four unsigned
integer values into a uniform location defined as a unsigned integer, an unsigned
integer vector, an array of unsigned integers or an array of unsigned integer vectors.
    The UniformMatrix{234}fv commands will load count 2 × 2, 3 × 3, or 4 × 4
matrices (corresponding to 2, 3, or 4 in the command name) of floating-point values
into a uniform location defined as a matrix or an array of matrices. If transpose
is FALSE, the matrix is specified in column major order, otherwise in row major
order.
    The UniformMatrix{2x3,3x2,2x4,4x2,3x4,4x3}fv commands will load count
2×3, 3×2, 2×4, 4×2, 3×4, or 4×3 matrices (corresponding to the numbers in the
command name) of floating-point values into a uniform location defined as a matrix
or an array of matrices. The first number in the command name is the number of
columns; the second is the number of rows. For example, UniformMatrix2x4fv
is used to load a matrix consisting of two columns and four rows. If transpose
is FALSE, the matrix is specified in column major order, otherwise in row major
order.
    When loading values for a uniform declared as a boolean, a boolean vector,
an array of booleans, or an array of boolean vectors, the Uniform*i{v}, Uni-
form*ui{v}, and Uniform*f{v} set of commands can be used to load boolean

values. Type conversion is done by the GL. The uniform is set to FALSE if the
input value is 0 or 0.0f, and set to TRUE otherwise. The Uniform* command used
must match the size of the uniform, as declared in the shader. For example, to
load a uniform declared as a bvec2, any of the Uniform2{if ui}* commands may
be used. An INVALID_OPERATION error will be generated if an attempt is made
to use a non-matching Uniform* command. In this example using Uniform1iv
would generate an error.
    For all other uniform types the Uniform* command used must match the
size and type of the uniform, as declared in the shader. No type conversions are
done. For example, to load a uniform declared as a vec4, Uniform4f{v} must be
used. To load a 3 × 3 matrix, UniformMatrix3fv must be used. An INVALID_-
OPERATION error will be generated if an attempt is made to use a non-matching
Uniform* command. In this example, using Uniform4i{v} would generate an
error.
    When loading N elements starting at an arbitrary position k in a uniform de-
clared as an array, elements k through k + N − 1 in the array will be replaced
with the new values. Values for any array element that exceeds the highest array
element index used, as reported by GetActiveUniform, will be ignored by the GL.
    If the value of location is -1, the Uniform* commands will silently ignore the
data passed in, and the current uniform values will not be changed.
    If any of the following conditions occur, an INVALID_OPERATION error is
generated by the Uniform* commands, and no uniform values are changed:

   • if the size indicated in the name of the Uniform* command used does not
     match the size of the uniform declared in the shader,

   • if the uniform declared in the shader is not of type boolean and the type
     indicated in the name of the Uniform* command used does not match the
     type of the uniform,

   • if count is greater than one, and the uniform declared in the shader is not an
     array variable,

   • if no variable with a location of location exists in the program object cur-
     rently in use and location is not -1, or

   • if there is no program object currently in use.

Uniform Blocks
The values of uniforms arranged in named uniform blocks are extracted from buffer
object storage. The mechanisms for placing individual uniforms in a buffer object

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                           70


and connecting a uniform block to an individual buffer object are described below.
    There is a set of implementation-dependent maximums for the number of
active uniform blocks used by each shader (vertex, geometry, and fragment).
If the number of uniform blocks used by any shader in the program exceeds
its corresponding limit, the program will fail to link. The limits for vertex,
geometry, and fragment shaders can be obtained by calling GetIntegerv with
pname values of MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_BLOCKS, MAX_GEOMETRY_UNIFORM_-
BLOCKS, and MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_BLOCKS, respectively.
    Additionally, there is an implementation-dependent limit on the sum of the
number of active uniform blocks used by each shader of a program. If a uniform
block is used by multiple shaders, each such use counts separately against this
combined limit. The combined uniform block use limit can be obtained by calling
GetIntegerv with a pname of MAX_COMBINED_UNIFORM_BLOCKS.
    When a named uniform block is declared by multiple shaders in a program, it
must be declared identically in each shader. The uniforms within the block must
be declared with the same names and types, and in the same order. If a program
contains multiple shaders with different declarations for the same named uniform
block differs between shader, the program will fail to link.

Uniform Buffer Object Storage
When stored in buffer objects associated with uniform blocks, uniforms are repre-
sented in memory as follows:

   • Members of type bool are extracted from a buffer object by reading a single
     uint-typed value at the specified offset. All non-zero values correspond to
     true, and zero corresponds to false.

   • Members of type int are extracted from a buffer object by reading a single
     int-typed value at the specified offset.

   • Members of type uint are extracted from a buffer object by reading a single
     uint-typed value at the specified offset.

   • Members of type float are extracted from a buffer object by reading a
     single float-typed value at the specified offset.

   • Vectors with N elements with basic data types of bool, int, uint, or
     float are extracted as N values in consecutive memory locations begin-
     ning at the specified offset, with components stored in order with the first
     (X) component at the lowest offset. The GL data type used for component
     extraction is derived according to the rules for scalar members above.

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                                71


   • Column-major matrices with C columns and R rows (using the type
     matCxR, or simply matC if C = R) are treated as an array of C floating-
     point column vectors, each consisting of R components. The column vec-
     tors will be stored in order, with column zero at the lowest offset. The dif-
     ference in offsets between consecutive columns of the matrix will be re-
     ferred to as the column stride, and is constant across the matrix. The column
     stride, UNIFORM_MATRIX_STRIDE, is an implementation-dependent value
     and may be queried after a program is linked.

   • Row-major matrices with C columns and R rows (using the type matCxR,
     or simply matC if C = R) are treated as an array of R floating-point row
     vectors, each consisting of C components. The row vectors will be stored in
     order, with row zero at the lowest offset. The difference in offsets between
     consecutive rows of the matrix will be referred to as the row stride, and is
     constant across the matrix. The row stride, UNIFORM_MATRIX_STRIDE, is
     an implementation-dependent value and may be queried after a program is
     linked.

   • Arrays of scalars, vectors, and matrices are stored in memory by element
     order, with array member zero at the lowest offset. The difference in offsets
     between each pair of elements in the array in basic machine units is referred
     to as the array stride, and is constant across the entire array. The array stride,
     UNIFORM_ARRAY_STRIDE, is an implementation-dependent value and may
     be queried after a program is linked.

Standard Uniform Block Layout
By default, uniforms contained within a uniform block are extracted from buffer
storage in an implementation-dependent manner. Applications may query the off-
sets assigned to uniforms inside uniform blocks with query functions provided by
the GL.
    The layout qualifier provides shaders with control of the layout of uniforms
within a uniform block. When the std140 layout is specified, the offset of each
uniform in a uniform block can be derived from the definition of the uniform block
by applying the set of rules described below.
    If a uniform block is declared in multiple shaders linked together into a single
program, the link will fail unless the uniform block declaration, including layout
qualifier, are identical in all such shaders.
    When using the std140 storage layout, structures will be laid out in buffer
storage with its members stored in monotonically increasing order based on their
location in the declaration. A structure and each structure member have a base

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                              72


offset and a base alignment, from which an aligned offset is computed by rounding
the base offset up to a multiple of the base alignment. The base offset of the first
member of a structure is taken from the aligned offset of the structure itself. The
base offset of all other structure members is derived by taking the offset of the
last basic machine unit consumed by the previous member and adding one. Each
structure member is stored in memory at its aligned offset. The members of a top-
level uniform block are laid out in buffer storage by treating the uniform block as
a structure with a base offset of zero.

   1. If the member is a scalar consuming N basic machine units, the base align-
      ment is N .

   2. If the member is a two- or four-component vector with components consum-
      ing N basic machine units, the base alignment is 2N or 4N , respectively.

   3. If the member is a three-component vector with components consuming N
      basic machine units, the base alignment is 4N .

   4. If the member is an array of scalars or vectors, the base alignment and array
      stride are set to match the base alignment of a single array element, according
      to rules (1), (2), and (3), and rounded up to the base alignment of a vec4. The
      array may have padding at the end; the base offset of the member following
      the array is rounded up to the next multiple of the base alignment.

   5. If the member is a column-major matrix with C columns and R rows, the
      matrix is stored identically to an array of C column vectors with R compo-
      nents each, according to rule (4).

   6. If the member is an array of S column-major matrices with C columns and
      R rows, the matrix is stored identically to a row of S × C column vectors
      with R components each, according to rule (4).

   7. If the member is a row-major matrix with C columns and R rows, the matrix
      is stored identically to an array of R row vectors with C components each,
      according to rule (4).

   8. If the member is an array of S row-major matrices with C columns and R
      rows, the matrix is stored identically to a row of S × R row vectors with C
      components each, according to rule (4).

   9. If the member is a structure, the base alignment of the structure is N , where
      N is the largest base alignment value of any of its members, and rounded

      up to the base alignment of a vec4. The individual members of this sub-
      structure are then assigned offsets by applying this set of rules recursively,
      where the base offset of the first member of the sub-structure is equal to the
      aligned offset of the structure. The structure may have padding at the end;
      the base offset of the member following the sub-structure is rounded up to
      the next multiple of the base alignment of the structure.

 10. If the member is an array of S structures, the S elements of the array are laid
     out in order, according to rule (9).

Uniform Buffer Object Bindings
The value an active uniform inside a named uniform block is extracted from the
data store of a buffer object bound to one of an array of uniform buffer binding
points. The number of binding points can be queried using GetIntegerv with the
constant MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS.
    Regions of buffer objects are bound as storage for uniform blocks by calling
one of the commands BindBufferRange or BindBufferBase (see section 2.9.1)
with target set to UNIFORM_BUFFER. In addition to the general errors described in
section 2.9.1, BindBufferRange will generate an INVALID_VALUE error if index
is greater than or equal to the value of MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS, or if
offset is not a multiple of the implementation-dependent alignment requirement
(the value of UNIFORM_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT).
    Each of a program’s active uniform blocks has a corresponding uniform buffer
object binding point. This binding point can be assigned by calling:

      void UniformBlockBinding( uint program,
         uint uniformBlockIndex, uint uniformBlockBinding );

program is a name of a program object for which the command LinkProgram has
been issued in the past.
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if uniformBlockIndex is not an active
uniform block index of program, or if uniformBlockBinding is greater than or equal
to the value of MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS.
    If successful, UniformBlockBinding specifies that program will use the data
store of the buffer object bound to the binding point uniformBlockBinding to extract
the values of the uniforms in the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex.
    When executing shaders that access uniform blocks, the binding point corre-
sponding to each active uniform block must be populated with a buffer object with
a size no smaller than the minimum required size of the uniform block (the value

2.11. VERTEX SHADERS                                                               74


of UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE). For binding points populated by BindBuffer-
Range, the size in question is the value of the size parameter. If any active uniform
block is not backed by a sufficiently large buffer object, the results of shader ex-
ecution are undefined, and may result in GL interruption or termination. Shaders
may be executed to process the primitives and vertices specified by vertex array
commands (see section 2.8).
    When a program object is linked or re-linked, the uniform buffer object binding
point assigned to each of its active uniform blocks is reset to zero.

2.11.5    Samplers
Samplers are special uniforms used in the OpenGL Shading Language to identify
the texture object used for each texture lookup. The value of a sampler indicates
the texture image unit being accessed. Setting a sampler’s value to i selects texture
image unit number i. The values of i range from zero to the implementation-
dependent maximum supported number of texture image units.
     The type of the sampler identifies the target on the texture image unit. The
texture object bound to that texture image unit’s target is then used for the texture
lookup. For example, a variable of type sampler2D selects target TEXTURE_2D
on its texture image unit. Binding of texture objects to targets is done as usual with
BindTexture. Selecting the texture image unit to bind to is done as usual with
ActiveTexture.
     The location of a sampler needs to be queried with GetUniformLocation, just
like any uniform variable. Sampler values need to be set by calling Uniform1i{v}.
Loading samplers with any of the other Uniform* entry points is not allowed and
will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error.
     It is not allowed to have variables of different sampler types pointing to the
same texture image unit within a program object. This situation can only be de-
tected at the next rendering command issued, and an INVALID_OPERATION error
will then be generated.
     Active samplers are samplers actually being used in a program object. The
LinkProgram command determines if a sampler is active or not. The LinkPro-
gram command will attempt to determine if the active samplers in the shader(s)
contained in the program object exceed the maximum allowable limits. If it deter-
mines that the count of active samplers exceeds the allowable limits, then the link
fails (these limits can be different for different types of shaders). Each active sam-
pler variable counts against the limit, even if multiple samplers refer to the same
texture image unit.

A vertex shader may define one or more varying variables (see the OpenGL Shad-
ing Language Specification). Varying variables are outputs of a vertex shader. The
OpenGL Shading Language Specification also defines a set of built-in varying and
special variables that vertex shaders can write to (see sections 7.1 and 7.6 of the
OpenGL Shading Language Specification). These varying variables are either used
as the mechanism to communicate values to a geometry shader, if one is active, or
to communicate values to the fragment shader and to the fixed-function processing
that occurs after vertex shading.
     If a geometry shader is not active, the values of all varying and special vari-
ables are expected to be interpolated across the primitive being rendered, unless
flatshaded. Otherwise the values of all varying and special variables are collected
by the primitive assembly stage and passed on to the geometry shader once enough
data for one primitive has been collected (see section 2.12).
     The number of components (individual scalar numeric values) of varying and
special variables that can be written by the vertex shader, whether or not a geometry
shader is active, is given by the value of the implementation-dependent constant
MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS. Outputs declared as vectors, matrices, and
arrays will all consume multiple components.
     When a program is linked, all components of any varying and special vari-
able written by a vertex shader will count against this limit. A program whose
vertex shader writes more than the value of MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS
components worth of varying variables may fail to link, unless device-dependent
optimizations are able to make the program fit within available hardware resources.
     Additionally, when linking a program containing only a vertex and frag-
ment shader, there is a limit on the total number of components used as vertex
shader outputs or fragment shader inputs. This limit is given by the value of the
implementation-dependent constant MAX_VARYING_COMPONENTS. Each varying
or special variable component used as either a vertex shader output or fragment
shader input count against this limit, except for the components of gl_Position.
A program containing only a vertex and fragment shader that accesses more than
this limit’s worth of components of varying and special variables may fail to link,
unless device-dependent optimizations are able to make the program fit within
available hardware resources.
     Each program object can specify a set of one or more vertex or geometry shader
output variables to be recorded in transform feedback mode (see section 2.16).
When a geometry shader is active (see section 2.12), transform feedback records
the values of the selected geometry shader output variables from the emitted ver-
tices. Otherwise, the values of the selected vertex shader output variables are

recorded. The values to record are specified with the command

      void TransformFeedbackVaryings( uint program,
         sizei count, const char **varyings, enum bufferMode );

     program specifies the program object. count specifies the number of vary-
ing variables used for transform feedback. varyings is an array of count zero-
terminated strings specifying the names of the varying variables to use for trans-
form feedback. Varying variables are written out in the order they appear in the
array varyings. bufferMode is either INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS or SEPARATE_-
ATTRIBS, and identifies the mode used to capture the varying variables when trans-
form feedback is active. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if bufferMode is
SEPARATE_ATTRIBS and count is greater than the value of the implementation-
dependent limit MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS.
     The state set by TransformFeedbackVaryings has no effect on the execu-
tion of the program until program is subsequently linked. When LinkProgram is
called, the program is linked so that the values of the specified varying variables
for the vertices of each primitive generated by the GL are written to a single buffer
object (if the buffer mode is INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS) or multiple buffer objects
(if the buffer mode is SEPARATE_ATTRIBS). A program will fail to link if:

   • the count specified by TransformFeedbackVaryings is non-zero, but the
     program object has no vertex or geometry shader;
   • any variable name specified in the varyings array is not declared as an output
     in the vertex shader (or the geometry shader, if active).
   • any two entries in the varyings array specify the same varying variable;
   • the total number of components to capture in any varying variable in varyings
     is greater than the constant MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_-
     COMPONENTS and the buffer mode is SEPARATE_ATTRIBS; or

   • the total number of components to capture is greater than the constant
     MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_INTERLEAVED_COMPONENTS and the buffer
     mode is INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS.

    To determine the set of varying variables in a linked program object that will
be captured in transform feedback mode, the command:

      void GetTransformFeedbackVarying( uint program,
         uint index, sizei bufSize, sizei *length, sizei *size,
         enum *type, char *name );

provides information about the varying variable selected by index. An index of 0
selects the first varying variable specified in the varyings array of TransformFeed-
backVaryings, and an index of TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS-1 selects the
last such varying variable. The value of TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS can
be queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.11). If index is greater than or
equal to TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS, the error INVALID_VALUE is gen-
erated. The parameter program is the name of a program object for which the com-
mand LinkProgram has been issued in the past. If program has not been linked,
the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated. If a new set of varying variables is
specified by TransformFeedbackVaryings after a program object has been linked,
the information returned by GetTransformFeedbackVarying will not reflect those
variables until the program is re-linked.
     The name of the selected varying is returned as a null-terminated string in
name. The actual number of characters written into name, excluding the null termi-
nator, is returned in length. If length is NULL, no length is returned. The maximum
number of characters that may be written into name, including the null terminator,
is specified by bufSize. The length of the longest varying name in program is
given by TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH, which can be queried
with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.11).
     For the selected varying variable, its type is returned into type. The size of
the varying is returned into size. The value in size is in units of the type returned
in type. The type returned can be any of the scalar, vector, or matrix attribute
types returned by GetActiveAttrib. If an error occurred, the return parameters
length, size, type and name will be unmodified. This command will return as much
information about the varying variables as possible. If no information is available,
length will be set to zero and name will be an empty string. This situation could
arise if GetTransformFeedbackVarying is called after a failed link.

2.11.7   Shader Execution
If a successfully linked program object that contains a vertex shader is made current
by calling UseProgram, the executable version of the vertex shader is used to
process incoming vertex values.
     If a geometry shader (see section 2.12) is active, vertices processed by the
vertex shader are passed to the geometry shader for further processing. Otherwise,
the following operations are applied to vertices processed by the vertex shader:

   • Perspective division on clip coordinates (section 2.13).

   • Viewport mapping, including depth range scaling (section 2.13.1).

   • Flatshading (section 2.18).

   • Clipping, including client-defined half-spaces (section 2.19).

   • Front face determination (section 3.6.1).

   • Generic attribute clipping (section 2.19.1).

    There are several special considerations for vertex shader execution described
in the following sections.

Shader Only Texturing
This section describes texture functionality that is accessible through vertex, ge-
ometry, or fragment shaders. Also refer to section 3.8 and to section 8.7 of the
OpenGL Shading Language Specification,

Texel Fetches
The OpenGL Shading Language texel fetch functions provide the ability to extract
a single texel from a specified texture image. The integer coordinates passed to
the texel fetch functions are used directly as the texel coordinates (i, j, k) into the
texture image. This in turn means the texture image is point-sampled (no filtering
is performed).
     The OpenGL Shading Language texel fetch functions provide the ability to ex-
tract a single texel from a specified texture image. The integer coordinates passed
to the texel fetch functions are used directly as the texel coordinates (i, j, k) into
the texture image. This in turn means the texture image is point-sampled (no filter-
ing is performed), but the remaining steps of texture access (described below) are
still applied.
     The level of detail accessed is computed by adding the specified level-of-detail
parameter lod to the base level of the texture, levelbase .
     The texel fetch functions can not perform depth comparisons or access cube
maps. Unlike filtered texel accesses, texel fetches do not support LOD clamping or
any texture wrap mode, and require a mipmapped minification filter to access any
level of detail other than the base level.
     The results of the texel fetch are undefined if any of the following conditions
hold:

   • the computed level of detail is less than the texture’s base level (levelbase ) or
     greater than the maximum level (levelmax )

   • the computed level of detail is not the texture’s base level and the texture’s
     minification filter is NEAREST or LINEAR

   • the layer specified for array textures is negative or greater than the number
     of layers in the array texture,

   • the texel coordinates (i, j, k) refer to a texel outside the defined extents of
     the specified level of detail, where any of

                            i<0                         i ≥ ws
                            j<0                         j ≥ hs
                            k<0                         k ≥ ds

      and the size parameters ws , hs , and ds refer to the width, height, and depth
      of the image, as in equation 3.16

   • the texture being accessed is not complete, as defined in section 3.8.14.

Multisample Texel Fetches
Multisample buffers do not have mipmaps, and there is no level of detail parameter
for multisample texel fetches. Instead, an integer parameter selects the sample
number to be fetched from the buffer. The number identifying the sample is the
same as the value used to query the sample location using GetMultisamplefv.
Multisample textures support only NEAREST filtering.
    Additionally, this fetch may only be performed on a multisample texture sam-
pler. No other sample or fetch commands may be performed on a multisample
texture sampler.

Texture Size Query
The OpenGL Shading Language texture size functions provide the ability to query
the size of a texture image. The LOD value lod passed in as an argument to the
texture size functions is added to the levelbase of the texture to determine a tex-
ture image level. The dimensions of that image level, excluding a possible bor-
der, are then returned. If the computed texture image level is outside the range
[levelbase , levelmax ], the results are undefined. When querying the size of an array
texture, both the dimensions and the layer index are returned.

Texture Access
Shaders have the ability to do a lookup into a texture map. The maximum num-
ber of texture image units available to vertex, geometry, or fragment shaders
are respectively the values of the implementation-dependent constants MAX_-
VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS, MAX_GEOMETRY_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS,
and MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS. The vertex shader, geometry shader, and frag-
ment shader combined cannot use more than the value of MAX_COMBINED_-
TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS texture image units. If more than one of the vertex
shader, geometry shader, and fragment processing stage access the same texture
image unit, each such access counts separately against the MAX_COMBINED_-
TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS limit.
    When a texture lookup is performed in a vertex or geometry shader, the filtered
texture value τ is computed in the manner described in sections 3.8.11 and 3.8.12,
and converted to a texture base color Cb as shown in table 3.20, followed by ap-
plication of the texture swizzle as described in section 3.9.2 to compute the texture
source color Cs and As .
    The resulting four-component vector (Rs , Gs , Bs , As ) is returned to the
shader. Texture lookup functions (see section 8.7 of the OpenGL Shading Lan-
guage Specification) may return floating-point, signed, or unsigned integer values
depending on the function and the internal format of the texture.
    In a vertex or geometry shader, it is not possible to perform automatic level-of-
detail calculations using partial derivatives of the texture coordinates with respect
to window coordinates as described in section 3.8.11. Hence, there is no automatic
selection of an image array level. Minification or magnification of a texture map
is controlled by a level-of-detail value optionally passed as an argument in the
texture lookup functions. If the texture lookup function supplies an explicit level-
of-detail value l, then the pre-bias level-of-detail value λbase (x, y) = l (replacing
equation 3.17). If the texture lookup function does not supply an explicit level-of-
detail value, then λbase (x, y) = 0. The scale factor ρ(x, y) and its approximation
function f (x, y) (see equation 3.21) are ignored.
    Texture lookups involving textures with depth component data can either re-
turn the depth data directly or return the results of a comparison with a reference
depth value specified in the coordinates passed to the texture lookup function, as
described in section 3.8.16. The comparison operation is requested in the shader by
using any of the shadow sampler types (sampler1DShadow, sampler2DShadow,
or sampler2DRectShadow), and in the texture using the TEXTURE_COMPARE_-
MODE parameter. These requests must be consistent; the results of a texture lookup
are undefined if any of the following conditions are true:
   • The sampler used in a texture lookup function is not one of the shadow

      sampler types, the texture object’s internal format is DEPTH_COMPONENT
      or DEPTH_STENCIL, and the TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is not NONE.

   • The sampler used in a texture lookup function is one of the shadow sam-
     pler types, the texture object’s internal format is DEPTH_COMPONENT or
     DEPTH_STENCIL, and the TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is NONE.

   • The sampler used in a texture lookup function is one of the shadow sampler
     types, and the texture object’s internal format is not DEPTH_COMPONENT or
     DEPTH_STENCIL.

    The stencil index texture internal component is ignored if the base internal
format is DEPTH_STENCIL.
    Using a sampler in a vertex or geometry shader will return (R, G, B, A) =
(0, 0, 0, 1) if the sampler’s associated texture is not complete, as defined in sec-
tion 3.8.14.

Shader Inputs
Besides having access to vertex attributes and uniform variables, vertex shaders
can access the read-only built-in variables gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID.
    gl_VertexID holds the integer index i implicitly passed by DrawArrays or
one of the other drawing commands defined in section 2.8.3.
    gl_InstanceID holds the integer index of the current primitive in an in-
stanced draw call (see section 2.8.3).
    Section 7.1 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification also describes
these variables.

Shader Outputs
A vertex shader can write to user-defined varying variables. These values are
expected to be interpolated across the primitive it outputs, unless they are specified
to be flat shaded. Refer to sections 4.3.6, 7.1, and 7.6 of the OpenGL Shading
Language Specification for more detail.
    The built-in special variable gl_Position is intended to hold the homoge-
neous vertex position. Writing gl_Position is optional.
    The built-in special variable gl_ClipDistance holds the clip distance(s)
used in the clipping stage, as described in section 2.19. If clipping is enabled,
gl_ClipDistance should be written.
    The built in special variable gl_PointSize, if written, holds the size of the
point to be rasterized, measured in pixels.

Validation
It is not always possible to determine at link time if a program object actually will
execute. Therefore validation is done when the first rendering command is issued,
to determine if the currently active program object can be executed. If it cannot be
executed then no fragments will be rendered, and the error INVALID_OPERATION
will be generated.
     This error is generated by any command that transfers vertices to the GL if:

   • any two active samplers in the current program object are of different types,
     but refer to the same texture image unit,

   • the number of active samplers in the program exceeds the maximum number
     of texture image units allowed.

    Undefined behavior results if the program object in use has no fragment shader
unless transform feedback is enabled, in which case only a vertex shader is re-
quired.
    The INVALID_OPERATION error reported by these rendering commands may
not provide enough information to find out why the currently active program object
would not execute. No information at all is available about a program object that
would still execute, but is inefficient or suboptimal given the current GL state. As
a development aid, use the command

      void ValidateProgram( uint program );

to validate the program object program against the current GL state. Each program
object has a boolean status, VALIDATE_STATUS, that is modified as a result of
validation. This status can be queried with GetProgramiv (see section 6.1.11).
If validation succeeded this status will be set to TRUE, otherwise it will be set to
FALSE. If validation succeeded the program object is guaranteed to execute, given
the current GL state. If validation failed, the program object is guaranteed to not
execute, given the current GL state.
    ValidateProgram will check for all the conditions that could lead to an
INVALID_OPERATION error when rendering commands are issued, and may check
for other conditions as well. For example, it could give a hint on how to optimize
some piece of shader code. The information log of program is overwritten with
information on the results of the validation, which could be an empty string. The
results written to the information log are typically only useful during application
development; an application should not expect different GL implementations to
produce identical information.

    A shader should not fail to compile, and a program object should not fail to
link due to lack of instruction space or lack of temporary variables. Implementa-
tions should ensure that all valid shaders and program objects may be successfully
compiled, linked and executed.

Undefined Behavior
When using array or matrix variables in a shader, it is possible to access a vari-
able with an index computed at run time that is outside the declared extent of the
variable. Such out-of-bounds accesses have undefined behavior, and system er-
rors (possibly including program termination) may occur. The level of protection
provided against such errors in the shader is implementation-dependent.

2.11.8   Required State
The GL maintains state to indicate which shader and program object names are in
use. Initially, no shader or program objects exist, and no names are in use.
    The state required per shader object consists of:

   • An unsigned integer specifying the shader object name.

   • An integer holding the value of SHADER_TYPE.

   • A boolean holding the delete status, initially FALSE.

   • A boolean holding the status of the last compile, initially FALSE.

   • An array of type char containing the information log, initially empty.

   • An integer holding the length of the information log.

   • An array of type char containing the concatenated shader string, initially
     empty.

   • An integer holding the length of the concatenated shader string.

The state required per program object consists of:

   • An unsigned integer indicating the program object name.

   • A boolean holding the delete status, initially FALSE.

   • A boolean holding the status of the last link attempt, initially FALSE.

   • A boolean holding the status of the last validation attempt, initally FALSE.

   • An integer holding the number of attached shader objects.

   • A list of unsigned integers to keep track of the names of the shader objects
     attached.

   • An array of type char containing the information log, initially empty.

   • An integer holding the length of the information log.

   • An integer holding the number of active uniforms.

   • For each active uniform, three integers, holding its location, size, and type,
     and an array of type char holding its name.

   • An array holding the values of each active uniform.

   • An integer holding the number of active attributes.

   • For each active attribute, three integers holding its location, size, and type,
     and an array of type char holding its name.

Additional state required to support vertex shaders consists of:

   • A bit indicating whether or not vertex program two-sided color mode is en-
     abled, initially disabled.

   • A bit indicating whether or not program point size mode (section 3.4.1) is
     enabled, initially disabled.

Additionally, one unsigned integer is required to hold the name of the current pro-
gram object, if any.


2.12     Geometry Shaders
After vertices are processed, they are arranged into primitives, as described in sec-
tion 2.6.1. This section describes optional geometry shaders, an additional pipeline
stage defining operations to further process those primitives. Geometry shaders are
defined by source code in the OpenGL Shading Language, in the same manner as
vertex shaders. They operate on a single primitive at a time and emit one or more
output primitives, all of the same type, which are then processed like an equivalent
OpenGL primitive specified by the application. The original primitive is discarded

after geometry shader execution. The inputs available to a geometry shader are the
transformed attributes of all the vertices that belong to the primitive. Additional
adjacency primitives are available which also make the transformed attributes of
neighboring vertices available to the shader. The results of the shader are a new set
of transformed vertices, arranged into primitives by the shader.
     The geometry shader pipeline stage is inserted after primitive assembly, prior
to transform feedback (section 2.16).
     Geometry shaders are created as described in section 2.11.1 using a type of
GEOMETRY_SHADER. They are attached to and used in program objects as described
in section 2.11.2. When the program object currently in use includes a geometry
shader, its geometry shader is considered active, and is used to process primitives.
If the program object has no geometry shader, this stage is bypassed.
     A program object that includes a geometry shader must also include a vertex
shader; otherwise a link error will occur.

2.12.1   Geometry Shader Input Primitives
A geometry shader can operate on one of five input primitive types. Depending on
the input primitive type, one to six input vertices are available when the shader is
executed. Each input primitive type supports a subset of the primitives provided by
the GL. If a geometry shader is active, any command that transfers vertices to the
GL will generate an INVALID_OPERATION error if the primitive mode parameter
is incompatible with the input primitive type of the currently active program object,
as discussed below.
     A geometry shader that accesses more input vertices than are available for a
given input primitive type can be successfully compiled, because the input prim-
itive type is not part of the shader object. However, a program object containing
a shader object that accesses more input vertices than are available for the input
primitive type of the program object will not link.
     The input primitive type is specified in the geometry shader source code using
an input layout qualifier, as described in the OpenGL Shading Language Specifi-
cation. A program will fail to link if the input primitive type is not specified by
any geometry shader object attached to the program, or if it is specified differently
by multiple geometry shader objects. The input primitive type may be queried by
calling GetProgramiv with the symbolic constant GEOMETRY_INPUT_TYPE. The
supported types and the corresponding OpenGL Shading Language input layout
qualifier keywords are:

Points (points)
   Geometry shaders that operate on points are valid only for the POINTS primi-

tive type. There is only a single vertex available for each geometry shader invoca-
tion.

Lines (lines)
    Geometry shaders that operate on line segments are valid only for the LINES,
LINE_STRIP, and LINE_LOOP primitive types. There are two vertices available
for each geometry shader invocation. The first vertex refers to the vertex at the
beginning of the line segment and the second vertex refers to the vertex at the end
of the line segment. See also section 2.12.4.

Lines with Adjacency (lines_adjacency)
    Geometry shaders that operate on line segments with adjacent vertices are valid
only for the LINES_ADJACENCY and LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY primitive types.
There are four vertices available for each program invocation. The second vertex
refers to attributes of the vertex at the beginning of the line segment and the third
vertex refers to the vertex at the end of the line segment. The first and fourth
vertices refer to the vertices adjacent to the beginning and end of the line segment,
respectively.

Triangles (triangles)
     Geometry shaders that operate on triangles are valid for the TRIANGLES,
TRIANGLE_STRIP and TRIANGLE_FAN primitive types. There are three vertices
available for each program invocation. The first, second and third vertices refer to
attributes of the first, second and third vertex of the triangle, respectively.

Triangles with Adjacency (triangles_adjacency)
    Geometry shaders that operate on triangles with adjacent vertices are valid
for the TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY and TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY primitive
types. There are six vertices available for each program invocation. The first, third
and fifth vertices refer to attributes of the first, second and third vertex of the tri-
angle, respectively. The second, fourth and sixth vertices refer to attributes of the
vertices adjacent to the edges from the first to the second vertex, from the second
to the third vertex, and from the third to the first vertex, respectively.

2.12.2    Geometry Shader Output Primitives
A geometry shader can generate primitives of one of three types. The supported
output primitive types are points (POINTS), line strips (LINE_STRIP), and triangle
strips (TRIANGLE_STRIP). The vertices output by the geometry shader are assem-
bled into points, lines, or triangles based on the output primitive type in the man-
ner described in section 2.6.1. The resulting primitives are then further processed

as described in section 2.12.4. If the number of vertices emitted by the geometry
shader is not sufficient to produce a single primitive, nothing is drawn. The number
of vertices output by the geometry shader is limited to a maximum count specified
in the shader.
     The output primitive type and maximum output vertex count are specified in
the geometry shader source code using an output layout qualifier, as described in
section 4.3.8.1 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. A program will
fail to link if either the output primitive type or maximum output vertex count are
not specified by any geometry shader object attached to the program, or if they
are specified differently by multiple geometry shader objects. The output primi-
tive type and maximum output vertex count of a linked program may be queried
by calling GetProgramiv with the symbolic constants GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_TYPE
and GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT, respectively.

2.12.3    Geometry Shader Variables
Geometry shaders can access uniforms belonging to the current program ob-
ject. The amount of storage available for geometry shader uniform variables is
specified by the implementation dependent constant MAX_GEOMETRY_UNIFORM_-
COMPONENTS. This value represents the number of individual floating-point, inte-
ger, or boolean values that can be held in uniform variable storage for a geometry
shader. A link error will be generated if an attempt is made to utilize more than the
space available for geometry shader uniform variables. Uniforms are manipulated
as described in section 2.11.4. Geometry shaders also have access to samplers to
perform texturing operations, as described in sections 2.11.5 and 3.8.
    Geometry shaders can access the transformed attributes of all vertices for their
input primitive type using input varying variables. A vertex shader writing to out-
put varying variables generates the values of these input varying variables, includ-
ing values for built-in as well as user-defined varying variables. Values for any
varying variables that are not written by a vertex shader are undefined. Addition-
ally, a geometry shader has access to a built-in variable that holds the ID of the
current primitive. This ID is generated by the primitive assembly stage that sits in
between the vertex and geometry shader.
    Additionally, geometry shaders can write to one or more varying variables for
each vertex they output. These values are optionally flatshaded (using the OpenGL
Shading Language varying qualifier flat) and clipped, then the clipped values
interpolated across the primitive (if not flatshaded). The results of these interpola-
tions are available to the fragment shader.

2.12.4   Geometry Shader Execution Environment
If a successfully linked program object that contains a geometry shader is made
current by calling UseProgram, the executable version of the geometry shader is
used to process primitives resulting from the primitive assembly stage.
    The following operations are applied to the primitives that are the result of
executing a geometry shader:

   • Perspective division on clip coordinates (section 2.13).

   • Viewport mapping, including depth range scaling (section 2.13.1).

   • Flatshading (section 2.18).

   • Clipping, including client-defined half-spaces (section 2.19).

   • Front face determination (section 3.6.1).

   • Generic attribute clipping (section 2.19.1).

    There are several special considerations for geometry shader execution de-
scribed in the following sections.

Texture Access
The Shader Only Texturing subsection of section 2.11.7 describes texture lookup
functionality accessible to a vertex shader. The texel fetch and texture size query
functionality described there also applies to geometry shaders.

Geometry Shader Inputs
Section 7.1 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification describes the built-in
variable array gl_in[] available as input to a geometry shader. gl_in[] receives
values from equivalent built-in output variables written by the vertex shader, and
each array element of gl_in[] is a structure holding values for a specific vertex of
the input primitive. The length of gl_in[] is determined by the geometry shader
input type (see section 2.12.1). The members of each element of the gl_in[]
array are:

   • Structure member gl_ClipDistance[] holds the per-vertex array of clip
     distances, as written by the vertex shader to its built-in output variable gl_-
     ClipDistance[].



                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
2.12. GEOMETRY SHADERS                                                              89


   • Structure member gl_PointSize holds the per-vertex point size written
     by the vertex shader to its built-in output varying variable gl_PointSize.
     If the vertex shader does not write gl_PointSize, the value of gl_-
     PointSize is undefined, regardless of the value of the enable PROGRAM_-
     POINT_SIZE.

   • Structure member gl_Position holds the per-vertex position, as written
     by the vertex shader to its built-in output variable gl_Position. Note that
     writing to gl_Position from either the vertex or geometry shader is op-
     tional (also see section 7.1 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification)

     Geometry shaders also have available the built-in special variable gl_-
PrimitiveIDIn, which is not an array and has no vertex shader equivalent. It
is filled with the number of primitives processed by the drawing command which
generated the input vertices. The first primitive generated by a drawing command
is numbered zero, and the primitive ID counter is incremented after every individ-
ual point, line, or triangle primitive is processed. For triangles drawn in point or
line mode, the primitive ID counter is incremented only once, even though multiple
points or lines may eventually be drawn. Restarting a primitive topology using the
primitive restart index has no effect on the primitive ID counter.
     Similarly to the built-in varying variables, each user-defined input varying vari-
able has a value for each vertex and thus needs to be declared as arrays or inside
input blocks declared as arrays. Declaring an array size is optional. If no size is
specified, it will be inferred by the linker from the input primitive type. If a size
is specified, it must match the number of vertices for the input primitive type; oth-
erwise, a link error will occur. The OpenGL Shading Language doesn’t support
multi-dimensional arrays; therefore, user-defined geometry shader inputs corre-
sponding to vertex shader outputs declared as arrays must be declared as array
members of an input block that is itself declared as an array. See sections 4.3.6
and 7.6 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification for more information.
     Similarly to the limit on vertex shader output components (see section 2.11.6),
there is a limit on the number of components of built-in and user-defined input
varying variables that can be read by the geometry shader, given by the value of
the implementation-dependent constant MAX_GEOMETRY_INPUT_COMPONENTS.
     When a program is linked, all components of any varying and special variable
read by a geometry shader will count against this limit. A program whose geometry
shader exceeds this limit may fail to link, unless device-dependent optimizations
are able to make the program fit within available hardware resources.
     Component counting rules for different variable types and variable declarations
are the same as for MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS. (see section 2.11.6).

Geometry Shader Outputs
A geometry shader is limited in the number of vertices it may emit per invocation.
The maximum number of vertices a geometry shader can possibly emit is spec-
ified in the geometry shader source and may be queried after linking by calling
GetProgramiv with the symbolic constant GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT. If a sin-
gle invocation of a geometry shader emits more vertices than this value, the emitted
vertices may have no effect.
     There are two implementation-dependent limits on the value of GEOMETRY_-
VERTICES_OUT; it may not exceed the value of MAX_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_-
VERTICES, and the product of the total number of vertices and the sum of all
components of all active varying variables may not exceed the value of MAX_-
GEOMETRY_TOTAL_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS. LinkProgram will fail if it deter-
mines that the total component limit would be violated.
     A geometry shader can write to built-in as well as user-defined varying vari-
ables. These values are expected to be interpolated across the primitive it outputs,
unless they are specified to be flat shaded. To enable seamlessly inserting or re-
moving a geometry shader from a program object, the rules, names and types of the
output built-in varying variables and user-defined varying variables are the same as
for the vertex shader. Refer to section 2.11.6, and sections 4.3.6, 7.1, and 7.6 of the
OpenGL Shading Language Specification for more detail.
     After a geometry shader emits a vertex, all built-in and user-defined output vari-
ables are undefined, as described in section 8.10 of the OpenGL Shading Language
Specification.
     The built-in special variable gl_Position is intended to hold the homoge-
neous vertex position. Writing gl_Position is optional.
     The built-in special variable gl_ClipDistance holds the clip distance used
in the clipping stage, as described in section 2.19.
     The built-in special variable gl_PointSize, if written, holds the size of the
point to be rasterized, measured in pixels.
     The built-in special variable gl_PrimitiveID holds the primitive ID counter
read by the fragment shader, replacing the value of gl_PrimitiveID generated
by drawing commands when no geometry shader is active. The geometry shader
must write to gl_PrimitiveID for the provoking vertex (see section 2.18) of a
primitive being generated, or the primitive ID counter read by the fragment shader
for that primitive is undefined.
     The built-in special variable gl_Layer is used in layered rendering, and dis-
cussed further in the next section.
     Similarly to the limit on vertex shader output components (see section 2.11.6),
there is a limit on the number of components of built-in and user-defined output

2.12. GEOMETRY SHADERS                                                          91


varying variables that can be written by the geometry shader, given by the value of
the implementation-dependent constant MAX_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS.
    When a program is linked, all components of any varying and special vari-
able written by a geometry shader will count against this limit. A program whose
geometry shader exceeds this limit may fail to link, unless device-dependent opti-
mizations are able to make the program fit within available hardware resources.
    Component counting rules for different variable types and variable declarations
are the same as for MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS. (see section 2.11.6).

Layered Rendering
Geometry shaders can be used to render to one of several different layers of cube
map textures, three-dimensional textures, or one-or two-dimensional texture ar-
rays. This functionality allows an application to bind an entire complex texture
to a framebuffer object, and render primitives to arbitrary layers computed at run
time. For example, it can be used to project and render a scene onto all six faces
of a cubemap texture in one pass. The layer to render to is specified by writing
to the built-in output variable gl_Layer. Layered rendering requires the use of
framebuffer objects (see section 4.4.7).

Primitive Type Mismatches and Drawing Commands
A geometry shader will fail to execute if a mismatch exists between the type of
primitive being drawn and the input primitive type of the shader. If it cannot be
executed then no fragments will be rendered, and the error INVALID_OPERATION
will be generated.
    This error is generated by any command that transfers vertices to the GL if a
geometry shader is active and:

   • the input primitive type of the current geometry shader is POINTS and mode
     is not POINTS;

   • the input primitive type of the current geometry shader is LINES and mode
     is not LINES, LINE_STRIP, or LINE_LOOP;

   • the input primitive type of the current geometry shader is TRIANGLES and
     mode is not TRIANGLES, TRIANGLE_STRIP or TRIANGLE_FAN;

   • the input primitive type of the current geometry shader is LINES_-
     ADJACENCY and mode is not LINES_ADJACENCY or LINE_STRIP_-
     ADJACENCY; or,

   • the input primitive type of the current geometry shader is TRIANGLES_-
     ADJACENCY and mode is not TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY or TRIANGLE_-
     STRIP_ADJACENCY.


2.13     Coordinate Transformations
Clip coordinates for a vertex result from vertex or, if active, geometry shader
execution, which yields a vertex coordinate gl_Position. Perspective division
on clip coordinates yields normalized device coordinates, followed by a viewport
transformation to convert these coordinates into window
                                                        coordinates.

                                                 yc 
    If a vertex in clip coordinates is given by     
                                                 zc 
                                                  wc
    then the vertex’s normalized device coordinates are
                                     xc 
                                    xd         wc
                                   yd  =  yc  .
                                               wc
                                               zc
                                    zd         wc


2.13.1    Controlling the Viewport
The viewport transformation is determined by the viewport’s width and height in
pixels, px and py , respectively,
                         and its center (ox , oy ) (also in pixels). The vertex’s
                         xw
window coordinates,  yw  , are given by
                         zw
                                 px             
                            xw          2 xd + ox
                            yw  =  py yd + oy  .
                                        2
                                     f −n      n+f
                             zw        2 zd + 2

The factor and offset applied to zd encoded by n and f are set using

       void DepthRange( clampd n, clampd f );

zw is represented as either fixed- or floating-point depending on whether the frame-
buffer’s depth buffer uses a fixed- or floating-point representation. If the depth
buffer uses fixed-point, we assume that it represents each value k/(2m − 1), where
k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 2m − 1}, as k (e.g. 1.0 is represented in binary as a string of all

ones). The parameters n and f are clamped to the range [0, 1], as are all arguments
of type clampd or clampf.
    Viewport transformation parameters are specified using

       void Viewport( int x, int y, sizei w, sizei h );

where x and y give the x and y window coordinates of the viewport’s lower left
corner and w and h give the viewport’s width and height, respectively. The viewport
parameters shown in the above equations are found from these values as

                                    ox = x + w2
                                    oy = y + h2
                                      px = w
                                      py = h.

    Viewport width and height are clamped to implementation-dependent maxi-
mums when specified. The maximum width and height may be found by issuing
an appropriate Get command (see chapter 6). The maximum viewport dimensions
must be greater than or equal to the larger of the visible dimensions of the display
being rendered to (if a display exists), and the largest renderbuffer image which
can be successfully created and attached to a framebuffer object (see chapter 4).
INVALID_VALUE is generated if either w or h is negative.
    The state required to implement the viewport transformation is four integers
and two clamped floating-point values. In the initial state, w and h are set to the
width and height, respectively, of the window into which the GL is to do its ren-
dering. If the default framebuffer is bound but no default framebuffer is associated
with the GL context (see chapter 4), then w and h are initially set to zero. ox , oy ,
n, and f are set to w2 , h2 , 0.0, and 1.0, respectively.


2.14     Asynchronous Queries
Asynchronous queries provide a mechanism to return information about the pro-
cessing of a sequence of GL commands. There are four query types supported
by the GL. Primitive queries with a target of PRIMITIVES_GENERATED (see
section 2.17) return information on the number of primitives processed by the
GL. Primitive queries with a target of TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_-
WRITTEN (see section 2.17) return information on the number of primitives written
to one more buffer objects. Occlusion queries (see section 4.1.6) count the number
of fragments or samples that pass the depth test, or set a boolean to true when any
fragments or samples pass the depth test. Timer queries (see section 5.1) record

2.14. ASYNCHRONOUS QUERIES                                                          94


the amount of time needed to fully process these commands or the current time of
the GL.
    The results of asynchronous queries are not returned by the GL immediately
after the completion of the last command in the set; subsequent commands can
be processed while the query results are not complete. When available, the query
results are stored in an associated query object. The commands described in sec-
tion 6.1.7 provide mechanisms to determine when query results are available and
return the actual results of the query. The name space for query objects is the
unsigned integers, with zero reserved by the GL.
    Each type of query supported by the GL has an active query object name. If
the active query object name for a query type is non-zero, the GL is currently
tracking the information corresponding to that query type and the query results
will be written into the corresponding query object. If the active query object for a
query type name is zero, no such information is being tracked.
    A query object is created and made active by calling

      void BeginQuery( enum target, uint id );

target indicates the type of query to be performed; valid values of target are defined
in subsequent sections. If id is an unused query object name, the name is marked
as used and associated with a new query object of the type specified by target.
Otherwise id must be the name of an existing query object of that type.
    BeginQuery fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if id is not
a name returned from a previous call to GenQueries, or if such a name has since
been deleted with DeleteQueries.
    BeginQuery sets the active query object name for the query type given by tar-
get to id. If BeginQuery is called with an id of zero, if the active query object name
for target is non-zero (for the targets SAMPLES_PASSED and ANY_SAMPLES_-
PASSED, if the active query for either target is non-zero), if id is the name of an
existing query object whose type does not match target, if id is the active query
object name for any query type, or if id is the active query object for condtional
rendering (see section 2.15), the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated.
    The command

      void EndQuery( enum target );

marks the end of the sequence of commands to be tracked for the query type given
by target. The active query object for target is updated to indicate that query results
are not available, and the active query object name for target is reset to zero. When
the commands issued prior to EndQuery have completed and a final query result

2.15. CONDITIONAL RENDERING                                                       95


is available, the query object active when EndQuery is called is updated by the
GL. The query object is updated to indicate that the query results are available and
to contain the query result. If the active query object name for target is zero when
EndQuery is called, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated.
    The command

       void GenQueries( sizei n, uint *ids );

returns n previously unused query object names in ids. These names are marked
as used, but no object is associated with them until the first time they are used by
BeginQuery.
    Query objects are deleted by calling

       void DeleteQueries( sizei n, const uint *ids );

ids contains n names of query objects to be deleted. After a query object is deleted,
its name is again unused. Unused names in ids are silently ignored. If an active
query object is deleted its name immediately becomes unused, but the underlying
object is not deleted until it is no longer active (see section D.1).
     Query objects contain two pieces of state: a single bit indicating whether a
query result is available, and an integer containing the query result value. The
number of bits used to represent the query result is implementation-dependent. In
the initial state of a query object, the result is available and its value is zero.
     The necessary state for each query type is an unsigned integer holding the
active query object name (zero if no query object is active), and any state necessary
to keep the current results of an asynchronous query in progress. Only a single type
of occlusion query can be active at one time, so the required state for occlusion
queries is shared.


2.15     Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering can be used to discard rendering commands based on the
result of an occlusion query. Conditional rendering is started and stopped using the
commands

       void BeginConditionalRender( uint id, enum mode );
       void EndConditionalRender( void );

id specifies the name of an occlusion query object whose results are used to deter-
mine if the rendering commands are discarded. If the result (SAMPLES_PASSED) of

2.16. TRANSFORM FEEDBACK                                                          96


the query is zero, or if the result (ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED) is false, all rendering
commands between BeginConditionalRender and the corresponding EndCondi-
tionalRender are discarded. In this case, all vertex array commands (see sec-
tion 2.8), as well as Clear and ClearBuffer* (see section 4.2.3), have no effect.
The effect of commands setting current vertex state, such as VertexAttrib, are un-
defined. If the result (SAMPLES_PASSED) of the query is non-zero, or if the result
(ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED) is true, such commands are not discarded.
    mode specifies how BeginConditionalRender interprets the results of the oc-
clusion query given by id. If mode is QUERY_WAIT, the GL waits for the results of
the query to be available and then uses the results to determine if subsquent render-
ing commands are discarded. If mode is QUERY_NO_WAIT, the GL may choose to
unconditionally execute the subsequent rendering commands without waiting for
the query to complete.
    If mode is QUERY_BY_REGION_WAIT, the GL will also wait for occlusion
query results and discard rendering commands if the result of the occlusion query is
zero. If the query result is non-zero, subsequent rendering commands are executed,
but the GL may discard the results of the commands for any region of the frame-
buffer that did not contribute to the sample count in the specified occlusion query.
Any such discarding is done in an implementation-dependent manner, but the ren-
dering command results may not be discarded for any samples that contributed
to the occlusion query sample count. If mode is QUERY_BY_REGION_NO_WAIT,
the GL operates as in QUERY_BY_REGION_WAIT, but may choose to uncondition-
ally execute the subsequent rendering commands without waiting for the query to
complete.
    If BeginConditionalRender is called while conditional rendering is in
progress, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated. If id is not the name of
an existing query object, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated. If id is the name
of a query object with a target other than SAMPLES_PASSED or ANY_SAMPLES_-
PASSED, or if id is the name of a query currently in progress, the error INVALID_-
OPERATION is generated.
    If EndConditionalRender is called while conditional rendering is not in
progress, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated.


2.16     Transform Feedback
In transform feedback mode, attributes of the vertices of transformed primitives
processed by a vertex shader, or primitives generated by a geometry shader if one

after vertex color clamping, but before flatshading and clipping. If a geometry

shader is active, the vertices recorded are those emitted from the geometry shader.
The transformed vertices may be optionally discarded after being stored into one
or more buffer objects, or they can be passed on down to the clipping stage for
further processing. The set of attributes captured is determined when a program is
linked.
    Transform feedback is started and finished by calling

      void BeginTransformFeedback( enum primitiveMode );

    and

      void EndTransformFeedback( void );

respectively. Transform feedback is said to be active after a call to BeginTrans-
formFeedback and inactive after a call to EndTransformFeedback. primitive-
Mode is one of TRIANGLES, LINES, or POINTS, and specifies the output type of
primitives that will be recorded into the buffer objects bound for transform feed-
back (see below). primitiveMode restricts the primitive types that may be rendered
while transform feedback is active, as shown in table 2.13.
    Transform feedback commands must be paired; the error INVALID_-
OPERATION is generated by BeginTransformFeedback if transform feedback is
active, and by EndTransformFeedback if transform feedback is inactive.
    Transform feedback mode captures the values of varying variables written by
the vertex shader (or, if active, geometry shader).
    When transform feedback is active, all geometric primitives generated must
be compatible with the value of primitiveMode passed to BeginTransformFeed-
back. The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by DrawArrays and the
other drawing commands defined in section 2.8.3 if mode is not one of the allowed
modes in table 2.13. If a geometry shader is active, its output primitive type is used
instead of of the mode parameter passed to drawing commands.

2.16. TRANSFORM FEEDBACK                                                             98


    Regions of buffer objects are bound as the targets of transform feedback by
calling one of the commands BindBufferRange or BindBufferBase (see sec-
tion 2.9.1) with target set to TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER. In addition to
the general errors described in section 2.9.1, BindBufferRange will generate an
INVALID_VALUE error if index is greater than or equal to the value of MAX_-
TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS, or if offset is not a multiple of 4.
    When an individual point, line, or triangle primitive reaches the transform feed-
back stage while transform feedback is active, the values of the specified varying
variables of the vertex are appended to the buffer objects bound to the transform
feedback binding points. The attributes of the first vertex received after Begin-
TransformFeedback are written at the starting offsets of the bound buffer objects
set by BindBufferRange, and subsequent vertex attributes are appended to the
buffer object. When capturing line and triangle primitives, all attributes of the first
vertex are written first, followed by attributes of the subsequent vertices. When
writing varying variables that are arrays, individual array elements are written in
order. For multi-component varying variables or varying array elements, the indi-
vidual components are written in order. The value for any attribute specified to be
streamed to a buffer object but not actually written by a vertex or geometry shader
is undefined.
    Individual lines or triangles of a strip or fan primitive will be extracted and
recorded separately. Incomplete primitives are not recorded.
    Transform feedback can operate in either INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS or
SEPARATE_ATTRIBS mode. In INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS mode, the values of one
or more varyings are written, interleaved, into the buffer object bound to the first
transform feedback binding point (index = 0). If more than one varying variable is
written, they will be recorded in the order specified by TransformFeedbackVary-
ings (see section 2.11.6). In SEPARATE_ATTRIBS mode, the first varying variable
specified by TransformFeedbackVaryings is written to the first transform feed-
back binding point; subsequent varying variables are written to the subsequent
transform feedback binding points. The total number of variables that may be cap-
tured in separate mode is given by MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_-
ATTRIBS.
    If recording the vertices of a primitive to the buffer objects being used for trans-
form feedback purposes would result in either exceeding the limits of any buffer
object’s size, or in exceeding the end position offset + size − 1, as set by Bind-
BufferRange, then no vertices of that primitive are recorded in any buffer object,
and the counter corresponding to the asynchronous query target TRANSFORM_-
FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN (see section 2.17) is not incremented.
    In either separate or interleaved modes, all transform feedback binding points
that will be written to must have buffer objects bound when BeginTransformFeed-

back is called. The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by BeginTrans-
formFeedback if any binding point used in transform feedback mode does not
have a buffer object bound. In interleaved mode, only the first buffer object bind-
ing point is ever written to. The error INVALID_OPERATION is also generated
by BeginTransformFeedback if no binding points would be used, either because
no program object is active or because the active program object has specified no
varying variables to record.
    While transform feedback is active, the set of attached buffer objects and the set
of varying variables captured may not be changed. If transform feedback is active,
the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by UseProgram, by LinkProgram
if program is the currently active program object, and by BindBufferRange or
BindBufferBase if target is TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER.
    Buffers should not be bound or in use for both transform feedback and other
purposes in the GL. Specifically, if a buffer object is simultaneously bound to a
transform feedback buffer binding point and elsewhere in the GL, any writes to
or reads from the buffer generate undefined values. Examples of such bindings
include ReadPixels to a pixel buffer object binding point and client access to a
buffer mapped with MapBuffer.
    However, if a buffer object is written and read sequentially by transform feed-
back and other mechanisms, it is the responsibility of the GL to ensure that data
are accessed consistently, even if the implementation performs the operations in a
pipelined manner. For example, MapBuffer may need to block pending the com-
pletion of a previous transform feedback operation.


2.17     Primitive Queries
Primitive queries use query objects to track the number of primitives generated by
the GL and to track the number of primitives written to transform feedback buffers.
    When BeginQuery is called with a target of PRIMITIVES_GENERATED, the
primitives-generated count maintained by the GL is set to zero. When the generated
primitive query is active, the primitives-generated count is incremented every time
a primitive reaches the transform feedback stage (see section 2.16), whether or
not transform feedback is active. This counter counts the number of primitives
emitted by a geometry shader, if active, possibly further tessellated into separate
primitives during the transform-feedback stage, if enabled.
    When BeginQuery is called with a target of TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_-
PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN, the transform-feedback-primitives-written count main-
tained by the GL is set to zero. When the transform feedback primitive written
query is active, the transform-feedback-primitives-written count is incremented ev-

ery time a primitive is recorded into a buffer object. If transform feedback is not
active, this counter is not incremented. If the primitive does not fit in the buffer
object, the counter is not incremented.
    These two queries can be used together to determine if all primitives have been
written to the bound feedback buffers; if both queries are run simultaneously and
the query results are equal, all primitives have been written to the buffer(s). If the
number of primitives written is less than the number of primitives generated, the
buffer is full.


2.18     Flatshading
Flatshading a vertex shader varying output means to assign all vertices of the
primitive the same value for that output.
    The varying output values assigned are those of the provoking vertex of the
primitive. The provoking vertex is controlled with the command

       void ProvokingVertex( enum provokeMode );

provokeMode must be either FIRST_VERTEX_CONVENTION or LAST_VERTEX_-
CONVENTION, and controls selection of the vertex whose values are assigned to
flatshaded colors and varying outputs, as shown in table 2.14
     If a vertex or geometry shader is active, user-defined varying outputs may be
flatshaded by using the flat qualifier when declaring the ouput, as described in
section 4.3.6 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
     The state required for flatshading is one bit for the provoking vertex mode,
and one implementation-dependent bit for the provoking vertex behavior of quad
primitives. The initial value of the provoking vertex mode is LAST_VERTEX_-
CONVENTION.


2.19     Primitive Clipping
Primitives are clipped to the clip volume. In clip coordinates, the view volume is
defined by
                                  −wc ≤ xc ≤ wc
                                  −wc ≤ yc ≤ wc
                                  −wc ≤ zc ≤ wc .
This view volume may be further restricted by as many as n client-defined half-
spaces. (n is an implementation-dependent maximum that must be at least 8.) The

the ith primitive generated by drawing commands with the indicated primitive type
are derived from the corresponding values of the vertex whose index is shown in
the table. Vertices are numbered 1 through n, where n is the number of vertices
drawn.

clip volume is the intersection of all such half-spaces with the view volume (if no
client-defined half-spaces are enabled, the clip volume is the view volume).
    A vertex shader may write a single clip distance for each supported half-space
to elements of the gl_ClipDistance[] array. Half-space n is then given by the
set of points satisfying the inequality

                                    cn (P ) ≥ 0,
    where cn (P ) is the value of clip distance n at point P . For point primitives,
cn (P ) is simply the clip distance for the vertex in question. For line and triangle
primitives, per-vertex clip distances are interpolated using a weighted mean, with
weights derived according to the algorithms described in sections 3.5 and 3.6.
    Client-defined half-spaces are enabled with the generic Enable command and
disabled with the Disable command. The value of the argument to either command
is CLIP_DISTANCEi, where i is an integer between 0 and n − 1; specifying a
value of i enables or disables the plane equation with index i. The constants obey
CLIP_DISTANCEi = CLIP_DISTANCE0 + i.
    Depth clamping is enabled with the generic Enable command and disabled
with the Disable command. The value of the argument to either command is

DEPTH_CLAMP. If depth clamping is enabled, the

                                   −wc ≤ zc ≤ wc

plane equation is ignored by view volume clipping (effectively, there is no near or
far plane clipping).
    If the primitive under consideration is a point, then clipping passes it un-
changed if it lies within the clip volume; otherwise, it is discarded.
    If the primitive is a line segment, then clipping does nothing to it if it lies
entirely within the clip volume, and discards it if it lies entirely outside the volume.
    If part of the line segment lies in the volume and part lies outside, then the
line segment is clipped and new vertex coordinates are computed for one or both
vertices. A clipped line segment endpoint lies on both the original line segment
and the boundary of the clip volume.
    This clipping produces a value, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, for each clipped vertex. If the
coordinates of a clipped vertex are P and the original vertices’ coordinates are P1
and P2 , then t is given by

                               P = tP1 + (1 − t)P2 .

The value of t is used to clip vertex shader varying variables as described in sec-
tion 2.19.1.
     If the primitive is a polygon, then it is passed if every one of its edges lies
entirely inside the clip volume and either clipped or discarded otherwise. Polygon
clipping may cause polygon edges to be clipped, but because polygon connectivity
must be maintained, these clipped edges are connected by new edges that lie along
the clip volume’s boundary. Thus, clipping may require the introduction of new
vertices into a polygon.
     If it happens that a polygon intersects an edge of the clip volume’s boundary,
then the clipped polygon must include a point on this boundary edge.
     Primitives rendered with user-defined half-spaces must satisfy a complemen-
tarity criterion. Suppose a series of primitives is drawn where each vertex i has a
single specified clip distance di (or a number of similarly specified clip distances,
if multiple half-spaces are enabled). Next, suppose that the same series of primi-
tives are drawn again with each such clip distance replaced by −di (and the GL
is otherwise in the same state). In this case, primitives must not be missing any
pixels, nor may any pixels be drawn twice in regions where those primitives are
cut by the clip planes.
     The state required for clipping is at least 8 bits indicating which of the client-
defined half-spaces are enabled. In the initial state, all half-spaces are disabled.

2.19.1     Clipping Shader Varying Outputs
    Next, vertex shader varying variables are clipped. The varying values associ-
ated with a vertex that lies within the clip volume are unaffected by clipping. If a
primitive is clipped, however, the varying values assigned to vertices produced by
clipping are clipped.
    Let the varying values assigned to the two vertices P1 and P2 of an unclipped
edge be c1 and c2 . The value of t (section 2.19) for a clipped point P is used to
obtain the varying value associated with P as 2

                                     c = tc1 + (1 − t)c2 .
(Multiplying a varying value by a scalar means multiplying each of x, y, z, and w
by the scalar.)
    Polygon clipping may create a clipped vertex along an edge of the clip volume’s
boundary. This situation is handled by noting that polygon clipping proceeds by
clipping against one half-space at a time. Varying value clipping is done in the
same way, so that clipped points always occur at the intersection of polygon edges
(possibly already clipped) with the clip volume’s boundary.
    For vertex shader varying variables specified to be interpolated without per-
spective correction (using the noperspective qualifier), the value of t used to
obtain the varying value associated with P will be adjusted to produce results that
vary linearly in screen space.
    Varying outputs of integer or unsigned integer type must always be declared
with the flat qualifier. Since such varyings are constant over the primitive being
rasterized (see sections 3.5.1 and 3.6.1), no interpolation is performed.




   2
     Since this computation is performed in clip space before division by wc , clipped varying values
are perspective-correct.

Chapter 3

Rasterization

Rasterization is the process by which a primitive is converted to a two-dimensional
image. Each point of this image contains such information as color and depth.
Thus, rasterizing a primitive consists of two parts. The first is to determine which
squares of an integer grid in window coordinates are occupied by the primitive.
The second is assigning a depth value and one or more color values to each such
square. The results of this process are passed on to the next stage of the GL (per-
fragment operations), which uses the information to update the appropriate loca-
tions in the framebuffer. Figure 3.1 diagrams the rasterization process. The color
values assigned to a fragment are determined by a fragment shader as defined in
section 3.9. The final depth value is initially determined by the rasterization op-
erations and may be modified or replaced by a fragment shader. The results from
rasterizing a point, line, or polygon are routed through a fragment shader.
    A grid square along with its z (depth) and varying shader output parameters is
called a fragment; the parameters are collectively dubbed the fragment’s associated
data. A fragment is located by its lower left corner, which lies on integer grid coor-
dinates. Rasterization operations also refer to a fragment’s center, which is offset
by (1/2, 1/2) from its lower left corner (and so lies on half-integer coordinates).
    Grid squares need not actually be square in the GL. Rasterization rules are not
affected by the actual aspect ratio of the grid squares. Display of non-square grids,
however, will cause rasterized points and line segments to appear fatter in one
direction than the other. We assume that fragments are square, since it simplifies
antialiasing and texturing.
    Several factors affect rasterization. Primitives may be discarded before ras-
terization. Points may be given differing diameters and line segments differing
widths. A point, line segment, or polygon may be antialiased.

3.1    Discarding Primitives Before Rasterization
Primitives can be optionally discarded before rasterization by calling Enable and
Disable with RASTERIZER_DISCARD. When enabled, primitives are discarded im-
mediately before the rasterization stage, but after the optional transform feedback
stage (see section 2.16). When disabled, primitives are passed through to the ras-
terization stage to be processed normally. When enabled, RASTERIZER_DISCARD
also causes the Clear and ClearBuffer* commands to be ignored.


3.2    Invariance
Consider a primitive p obtained by translating a primitive p through an offset (x, y)
in window coordinates, where x and y are integers. As long as neither p nor p is
clipped, it must be the case that each fragment f produced from p is identical to
a corresponding fragment f from p except that the center of f is offset by (x, y)
from the center of f .

3.3    Antialiasing
The R, G, and B values of the rasterized fragment are left unaffected, but the A
value is multiplied by a floating-point value in the range [0, 1] that describes a
fragment’s screen pixel coverage. The per-fragment stage of the GL can be set up
to use the A value to blend the incoming fragment with the corresponding pixel
already present in the framebuffer.
     The details of how antialiased fragment coverage values are computed are dif-
ficult to specify in general. The reason is that high-quality antialiasing may take
into account perceptual issues as well as characteristics of the monitor on which
the contents of the framebuffer are displayed. Such details cannot be addressed
within the scope of this document. Further, the coverage value computed for a
fragment of some primitive may depend on the primitive’s relationship to a num-
ber of grid squares neighboring the one corresponding to the fragment, and not just
on the fragment’s grid square. Another consideration is that accurate calculation
of coverage values may be computationally expensive; consequently we allow a
given GL implementation to approximate true coverage values by using a fast but
not entirely accurate coverage computation.
     In light of these considerations, we chose to specify the behavior of exact an-
tialiasing in the prototypical case that each displayed pixel is a perfect square of
uniform intensity. The square is called a fragment square and has lower left corner
(x, y) and upper right corner (x+1, y +1). We recognize that this simple box filter
may not produce the most favorable antialiasing results, but it provides a simple,
well-defined model.
     A GL implementation may use other methods to perform antialiasing, subject
to the following conditions:
   1. If f1 and f2 are two fragments, and the portion of f1 covered by some prim-
      itive is a subset of the corresponding portion of f2 covered by the primitive,
      then the coverage computed for f1 must be less than or equal to that com-
      puted for f2 .
   2. The coverage computation for a fragment f must be local: it may depend
      only on f ’s relationship to the boundary of the primitive being rasterized. It
      may not depend on f ’s x and y coordinates.
Another property that is desirable, but not required, is:
   3. The sum of the coverage values for all fragments produced by rasterizing a
      particular primitive must be constant, independent of any rigid motions in
      window coordinates, as long as none of those fragments lies along window
      edges.

3.3. ANTIALIASING                                                                  107


In some implementations, varying degrees of antialiasing quality may be obtained
by providing GL hints (section 5.4), allowing a user to make an image quality
versus speed tradeoff.

3.3.1    Multisampling
Multisampling is a mechanism to antialias all GL primitives: points, lines, and
polygons. The technique is to sample all primitives multiple times at each pixel.
The color sample values are resolved to a single, displayable color each time a
pixel is updated, so the antialiasing appears to be automatic at the application level.
Because each sample includes color, depth, and stencil information, the color (in-
cluding texture operation), depth, and stencil functions perform equivalently to the
single-sample mode.
    An additional buffer, called the multisample buffer, is added to the framebuffer.
Pixel sample values, including color, depth, and stencil values, are stored in this
buffer. Samples contain separate color values for each fragment color. When
the framebuffer includes a multisample buffer, it does not include depth or sten-
cil buffers, even if the multisample buffer does not store depth or stencil values.
Color buffers do coexist with the multisample buffer, however.
    Multisample antialiasing is most valuable for rendering polygons, because it
requires no sorting for hidden surface elimination, and it correctly handles adja-
cent polygons, object silhouettes, and even intersecting polygons. If only lines
are being rendered, the “smooth” antialiasing mechanism provided by the base GL
may result in a higher quality image. This mechanism is designed to allow multi-
sample and smooth antialiasing techniques to be alternated during the rendering of
a single scene.
    If the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, the rasterization of all primitives
is changed, and is referred to as multisample rasterization. Otherwise, primitive
rasterization is referred to as single-sample rasterization. The value of SAMPLE_-
BUFFERS is queried by calling GetIntegerv with pname set to SAMPLE_BUFFERS.
    During multisample rendering the contents of a pixel fragment are changed
in two ways. First, each fragment includes a coverage value with SAMPLES bits.
The value of SAMPLES is an implementation-dependent constant, and is queried by

    The location of a given sample is queried with the command

        void GetMultisamplefv( enum pname, uint index,
           float *val );

pname must be SAMPLE_POSITION, and index corresponds to the sample for
which the location should be returned. The sample location is returned as two

floating point values in val[0] and val[1], each between 0 and 1, corresponding to
the x and y locations respectively in GL pixel space of that sample. (0.5, 0.5) thus
corresponds to the pixel center. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if index
is greater than or equal to the value of SAMPLES. If the multisample mode does not
have fixed sample locations, the returned values may only reflect the locations of
samples within some pixels.
    Second, each fragment includes SAMPLES depth values and sets of associated
data, instead of the single depth value and set of associated data that is maintained
in single-sample rendering mode. An implementation may choose to assign the
same associated data to more than one sample. The location for evaluating such
associated data can be anywhere within the pixel including the fragment center or
any of the sample locations. The different associated data values need not all be
evaluated at the same location. Each pixel fragment thus consists of integer x and y
grid coordinates, SAMPLES depth values and sets of associated data, and a coverage
value with a maximum of SAMPLES bits.
    Multisample rasterization is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable
with the symbolic constant MULTISAMPLE.
    If MULTISAMPLE is disabled, multisample rasterization of all primitives is
equivalent to single-sample (fragment-center) rasterization, except that the frag-
ment coverage value is set to full coverage. The color and depth values and the
sets of texture coordinates may all be set to the values that would have been as-
signed by single-sample rasterization, or they may be assigned as described below
for multisample rasterization.
    If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, multisample rasterization of all primitives differs
substantially from single-sample rasterization. It is understood that each pixel in
the framebuffer has SAMPLES locations associated with it. These locations are
exact positions, rather than regions or areas, and each is referred to as a sample
point. The sample points associated with a pixel may be located inside or outside
of the unit square that is considered to bound the pixel. Furthermore, the relative
locations of sample points may be identical for each pixel in the framebuffer, or
they may differ.
    If the sample locations differ per pixel, they should be aligned to window, not
screen, boundaries. Otherwise rendering results will be window-position specific.
The invariance requirement described in section 3.2 is relaxed for all multisample
rasterization, because the sample locations may be a function of pixel location.

3.4    Points
A point is drawn by generating a set of fragments in the shape of a square or circle
centered around the vertex of the point. Each vertex has an associated point size
that controls the size of that square or circle.
     If point size mode is enabled, then the derived point size is taken from the (po-
tentially clipped) shader built-in gl_PointSize written by the geometry shader,
or written by the vertex shader if no geometry shader is active, and clamped to the
implementation-dependent point size range. If the value written to gl_PointSize
is less than or equal to zero, results are undefined. If point size mode is disabled,
then the derived point size is specified with the command

      void PointSize( float size );

size specifies the requested size of a point. The default value is 1.0. A value less
than or equal to zero results in the error INVALID_VALUE. Program point size
mode is enabled and disabled by calling Enable or Disable with the symbolic
value PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE.
    If multisampling is enabled, an implementation may optionally fade the point
alpha (see section 3.11) instead of allowing the point width to go below a given
threshold. In this case, the width of the rasterized point is

                          derived size derived size ≥ threshold
            width =                                                             (3.1)
                          threshold    otherwise
and the fade factor is computed as follows:

                         1                    derived size ≥ threshold
            f ade =          derived size 2                                     (3.2)
                              threshold       otherwise
    The point fade threshold is specified with

      void PointParameter{if}( enum pname, T param );
      void PointParameter{if}v( enum pname, const T params );

    If pname is POINT_FADE_THRESHOLD_SIZE, then param specifies, or params
points to the point fade threshold. Values of POINT_FADE_THRESHOLD_SIZE
less than zero result in the error INVALID_VALUE.
    The point sprite texture coordinate origin is set with the PointParame-
ter* commands where pname is POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN and param is
LOWER_LEFT or UPPER_LEFT. The default value is UPPER_LEFT.

3.4.1   Basic Point Rasterization
Point rasterization produces a fragment for each framebuffer pixel whose center
lies inside a square centered at the point’s (xw , yw ), with side length equal to the
current point size.
     All fragments produced in rasterizing a point sprite are assigned the same as-
sociated data, which are those of the vertex corresponding to the point. However,
the fragment shader builtin gl_PointCoord contains point sprite texture coordi-
nates. The s point sprite texture coordinate varies from 0 to 1 across the point hor-
izontally left-to-right. If POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN is LOWER_LEFT, the t
coordinate varies from 0 to 1 vertically bottom-to-top. Otherwise if the point sprite
texture coordinate origin is UPPER_LEFT, the t coordinate varies from 0 to 1 verti-
cally top-to-bottom. The r and q coordinates are replaced with the constants 0 and
1, respectively.
     The following formula is used to evaluate the s and t point sprite texture coor-
dinates:

                                           1   xf + 21 − xw
                                      s=     +                                  (3.3)
                                           2       size

        
            1       (yf + 12 −yw )
                +                    , POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN = LOWER_LEFT
        
  t=        2           size
            1       (yf + 12 −yw )
        
            2   −       size   , POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN = UPPER_LEFT
                                                                              (3.4)
where size is the point’s size, xf and yf are the (integral) window coordinates of
the fragment, and xw and yw are the exact, unrounded window coordinates of the
vertex for the point.
    Not all point widths need be supported, but the width 1.0 must be provided.
The range of supported widths and the width of evenly-spaced gradations within
that range are implementation-dependent. The range and gradations may be ob-
tained using the query mechanism described in chapter 6. If, for instance, the
width range is from 0.1 to 2.0 and the gradation width is 0.1, then the widths
0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.9, 2.0 are supported. Additional point widths may also be sup-
ported. There is no requirement that these widths must be equally spaced. If
an unsupported width is requested, the nearest supported width is used instead.

3.4.2   Point Rasterization State
The state required to control point rasterization consists of the floating-point point
width, a bit indicating whether or not vertex program point size mode is enabled,

a bit for the point sprite texture coordinate origin, and a floating-point value speci-
fying the point fade threshold size.

3.4.3    Point Multisample Rasterization
If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, then points
are rasterized using the following algorithm. Point rasterization produces a frag-
ment for each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that intersect a
region centered at the point’s (xw , yw ). This region is a square with side equal
to the current point width. Coverage bits that correspond to sample points that
intersect the region are 1, other coverage bits are 0. All data associated with each
sample for the fragment are the data associated with the point being rasterized.
    The set of point sizes supported is equivalent to those for point sprites without
multisample .


3.5     Line Segments
A line segment results from a line strip, a line loop, or a series of separate line
segments. Line segment rasterization is controlled by several variables. Line width,
which may be set by calling

        void LineWidth( float width );

with an appropriate positive floating-point width, controls the width of rasterized
line segments. The default width is 1.0. Values less than or equal to 0.0 generate
the error INVALID_VALUE. Antialiasing is controlled with Enable and Disable
using the symbolic constant LINE_SMOOTH.

3.5.1    Basic Line Segment Rasterization
Line segment rasterization begins by characterizing the segment as either x-major
or y-major. x-major line segments have slope in the closed interval [−1, 1]; all
other line segments are y-major (slope is determined by the segment’s endpoints).
We shall specify rasterization only for x-major segments except in cases where the
modifications for y-major segments are not self-evident.
    Ideally, the GL uses a “diamond-exit” rule to determine those fragments that
are produced by rasterizing a line segment. For each fragment f with center at win-
dow coordinates xf and yf , define a diamond-shaped region that is the intersection
of four half planes:

                   Rf = { (x, y) | |x − xf | + |y − yf | < 1/2.}

   Figure 3.2. Visualization of Bresenham’s algorithm. A portion of a line segment is

   those regions that the line segment exits cause rasterization to produce correspond-

    Essentially, a line segment starting at pa and ending at pb produces those frag-
ments f for which the segment intersects Rf , except if pb is contained in Rf . See
figure 3.2.
    To avoid difficulties when an endpoint lies on a boundary of Rf we (in princi-
ple) perturb the supplied endpoints by a tiny amount. Let pa and pb have window
coordinates (xa , ya ) and (xb , yb ), respectively. Obtain the perturbed endpoints pa
given by (xa , ya ) − ( , 2 ) and pb given by (xb , yb ) − ( , 2 ). Rasterizing the line
segment starting at pa and ending at pb produces those fragments f for which the
segment starting at pa and ending on pb intersects Rf , except if pb is contained in
Rf . is chosen to be so small that rasterizing the line segment produces the same
fragments when δ is substituted for for any 0 < δ ≤ .
    When pa and pb lie on fragment centers, this characterization of fragments
reduces to Bresenham’s algorithm with one modification: lines produced in this
description are “half-open,” meaning that the final fragment (corresponding to pb )
is not drawn. This means that when rasterizing a series of connected line segments,
shared endpoints will be produced only once rather than twice (as would occur with
Bresenham’s algorithm).
    Because the initial and final conditions of the diamond-exit rule may be difficult
to implement, other line segment rasterization algorithms are allowed, subject to

the following rules:

   1. The coordinates of a fragment produced by the algorithm may not deviate by
      more than one unit in either x or y window coordinates from a corresponding
      fragment produced by the diamond-exit rule.

   2. The total number of fragments produced by the algorithm may differ from
      that produced by the diamond-exit rule by no more than one.

   3. For an x-major line, no two fragments may be produced that lie in the same
      window-coordinate column (for a y-major line, no two fragments may ap-
      pear in the same row).

   4. If two line segments share a common endpoint, and both segments are either
      x-major (both left-to-right or both right-to-left) or y-major (both bottom-to-
      top or both top-to-bottom), then rasterizing both segments may not produce
      duplicate fragments, nor may any fragments be omitted so as to interrupt
      continuity of the connected segments.

    Next we must specify how the data associated with each rasterized fragment
are obtained. Let the window coordinates of a produced fragment center be given
by pr = (xd , yd ) and let pa = (xa , ya ) and pb = (xb , yb ). Set

                                (pr − pa ) · (pb − pa )
                           t=                           .                      (3.5)
                                      pb − pa 2
(Note that t = 0 at pa and t = 1 at pb .) The value of an associated datum f for the
fragment, whether it be a varying shader output or the clip w coordinate, is found
as

                                (1 − t)fa /wa + tfb /wb
                           f=                                                  (3.6)
                                  (1 − t)/wa + t/wb
where fa and fb are the data associated with the starting and ending endpoints of
the segment, respectively; wa and wb are the clip w coordinates of the starting and
ending endpoints of the segments, respectively. However, depth values for lines
must be interpolated by
                               z = (1 − t)za + tzb                             (3.7)
where za and zb are the depth values of the starting and ending endpoints of the
segment, respectively.
    The noperspective and flat keywords used to declare varying shader
outputs affect how they are interpolated. When neither keyword is specified, inter-
polation is performed as described in equation 3.6. When the noperspective

keyword is specified, interpolation is performed in the same fashion as for depth
values, as described in equation 3.7. When the flat keyword is specified, no
interpolation is performed, and varying outputs are taken from the corresponding
varying value of the provoking vertex corresponding to that primitive (see sec-
tion 2.18).

3.5.2   Other Line Segment Features
We have just described the rasterization of non-antialiased line segments of width
one. We now describe the rasterization of line segments for general values of the
line segment rasterization parameters.

Antialiasing
Rasterized antialiased line segments produce fragments whose fragment squares
intersect a rectangle centered on the line segment. Two of the edges are parallel to
the specified line segment; each is at a distance of one-half the current width from
that segment: one above the segment and one below it. The other two edges pass
through the line endpoints and are perpendicular to the direction of the specified
line segment. Coverage values are computed for each fragment by computing the
area of the intersection of the rectangle with the fragment square (see figure 3.3;
see also section 3.3). Equation 3.6 is used to compute associated data values just as
with non-antialiased lines; equation 3.5 is used to find the value of t for each frag-
ment whose square is intersected by the line segment’s rectangle. Not all widths
need be supported for line segment antialiasing, but width 1.0 antialiased segments
must be provided. As with the point width, a GL implementation may be queried
for the range and number of gradations of available antialiased line widths.

3.5.3   Line Rasterization State
The state required for line rasterization consists of the floating-point line width
and a bit indicating whether line antialiasing is on or off. The initial value of the
line width is 1.0. The initial state of line segment antialiasing is disabled.

3.5.4   Line Multisample Rasterization
If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, then lines
are rasterized using the following algorithm, regardless of whether line antialiasing
(LINE_SMOOTH) is enabled or disabled. Line rasterization produces a fragment for
each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that intersect the rectangular

Segment Features).
    Coverage bits that correspond to sample points that intersect a retained rectan-
gle are 1, other coverage bits are 0. Each depth value and set of associated data is
produced by substituting the corresponding sample location into equation 3.5, then
using the result to evaluate equation 3.7. An implementation may choose to as-
sign the associated data to more than one sample by evaluating equation 3.5 at any
location within the pixel including the fragment center or any one of the sample
locations, then substituting into equation 3.6. The different associated data values
need not be evaluated at the same location.
    Line width range and number of gradations are equivalent to those supported
for antialiased lines.


3.6    Polygons
A polygon results from a triangle arising from a triangle strip, triangle fan, or
series of separate triangles. Like points and line segments, polygon rasterization
is controlled by several variables. Polygon antialiasing is controlled with Enable
and Disable with the symbolic constant POLYGON_SMOOTH.

3.6.1    Basic Polygon Rasterization
The first step of polygon rasterization is to determine if the polygon is back-facing
or front-facing. This determination is made based on the sign of the (clipped or
unclipped) polygon’s area computed in window coordinates. One way to compute
this area is
                                  n−1
                              1
                           a=           xiw yw
                                             i⊕1    i⊕1 i
                                                 − xw  yw                       (3.8)
                              2
                                  i=0

    where xiw and ywi are the x and y window coordinates of the ith vertex of

the n-vertex polygon (vertices are numbered starting at zero for purposes of this
computation) and i⊕1 is (i+1) mod n. The interpretation of the sign of this value
is controlled with

        void FrontFace( enum dir );

     Setting dir to CCW (corresponding to counter-clockwise orientation of the pro-
jected polygon in window coordinates) uses a as computed above. Setting dir to
CW (corresponding to clockwise orientation) indicates that the sign of a should be
reversed prior to use. Front face determination requires one bit of state, and is
initially set to CCW.
     If the sign of a (including the possible reversal of this sign as determined by
FrontFace) is positive, the polygon is front-facing; otherwise, it is back-facing.
This determination is used in conjunction with the CullFace enable bit and mode
value to decide whether or not a particular polygon is rasterized. The CullFace
mode is set by calling

        void CullFace( enum mode );

mode is a symbolic constant: one of FRONT, BACK or FRONT_AND_BACK. Culling
is enabled or disabled with Enable or Disable using the symbolic constant CULL_-
FACE. Front-facing polygons are rasterized if either culling is disabled or the Cull-
Face mode is BACK while back-facing polygons are rasterized only if either culling
is disabled or the CullFace mode is FRONT. The initial setting of the CullFace
mode is BACK. Initially, culling is disabled.
    The rule for determining which fragments are produced by polygon rasteriza-
tion is called point sampling. The two-dimensional projection obtained by taking
the x and y window coordinates of the polygon’s vertices is formed. Fragment
centers that lie inside of this polygon are produced by rasterization. Special treat-
ment is given to a fragment whose center lies on a polygon edge. In such a case

                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
3.6. POLYGONS                                                                        117


we require that if two polygons lie on either side of a common edge (with identical
endpoints) on which a fragment center lies, then exactly one of the polygons results
in the production of the fragment during rasterization.
    As for the data associated with each fragment produced by rasterizing a poly-
gon, we begin by specifying how these values are produced for fragments in a
triangle. Define barycentric coordinates for a triangle. Barycentric coordinates are
a set of three numbers, a, b, and c, each in the range [0, 1], with a + b + c = 1.
These coordinates uniquely specify any point p within the triangle or on the trian-
gle’s boundary as
                               p = apa + bpb + cpc ,
where pa , pb , and pc are the vertices of the triangle. a, b, and c can be found as

                    A(ppb pc )              A(ppa pc )            A(ppa pb )
              a=                 ,     b=                ,   c=                ,
                    A(pa pb pc )            A(pa pb pc )          A(pa pb pc )

where A(lmn) denotes the area in window coordinates of the triangle with vertices
l, m, and n.
    Denote an associated datum at pa , pb , or pc as fa , fb , or fc , respectively. Then
the value f of a datum at a fragment produced by rasterizing a triangle is given by

                                afa /wa + bfb /wb + cfc /wc
                          f=                                                        (3.9)
                                   a/wa + b/wb + c/wc
where wa , wb and wc are the clip w coordinates of pa , pb , and pc , respectively.
a, b, and c are the barycentric coordinates of the fragment for which the data are
produced. a, b, and c must correspond precisely to the exact coordinates of the
center of the fragment. Another way of saying this is that the data associated with
a fragment must be sampled at the fragment’s center. However, depth values for
polygons must be interpolated by

                                     z = aza + bzb + czc                           (3.10)

where za , zb , and zc are the depth values of pa , pb , and pc , respectively.
    The noperspective and flat keywords used to declare varying shader
outputs affect how they are interpolated. When neither keyword is specified, inter-
polation is performed as described in equation 3.9. When the noperspective
keyword is specified, interpolation is performed in the same fashion as for depth
values, as described in equation 3.10. When the flat keyword is specified, no
interpolation is performed, and varying outputs are taken from the corresponding
varying value of the provoking vertex corresponding to that primitive (see sec-
tion 2.18).

3.6. POLYGONS                                                                     118


     For a polygon with more than three edges, such as may be produced by clipping
a triangle, we require only that a convex combination of the values of the datum
at the polygon’s vertices can be used to obtain the value assigned to each fragment
produced by the rasterization algorithm. That is, it must be the case that at every
fragment
                                          n
                                    f=         ai fi
                                         i=1

where n is the number of vertices in the polygon, fi is the value of the f at vertex
i; for each i 0 ≤ ai ≤ 1 and ni=1 ai = 1. The values of the ai may differ from
fragment to fragment, but at vertex i, aj = 0, j = i and ai = 1.
     One algorithm that achieves the required behavior is to triangulate a polygon
(without adding any vertices) and then treat each triangle individually as already
discussed. A scan-line rasterizer that linearly interpolates data along each edge
and then linearly interpolates data across each horizontal span from edge to edge
also satisfies the restrictions (in this case, the numerator and denominator of equa-
tion 3.9 should be iterated independently and a division performed for each frag-
ment).

3.6.2    Antialiasing
Polygon antialiasing rasterizes a polygon by producing a fragment wherever the
interior of the polygon intersects that fragment’s square. A coverage value is com-
puted at each such fragment, and this value is saved to be applied as described
in section 3.10. An associated datum is assigned to a fragment by integrating the
datum’s value over the region of the intersection of the fragment square with the
polygon’s interior and dividing this integrated value by the area of the intersection.
For a fragment square lying entirely within the polygon, the value of a datum at the
fragment’s center may be used instead of integrating the value across the fragment.

3.6.3    Options Controlling Polygon Rasterization
The interpretation of polygons for rasterization is controlled using

        void PolygonMode( enum face, enum mode );

face must be FRONT_AND_BACK, indicating that the rasterizing method described
by mode replaces the rasterizing method for both front- and back-facing polygons.
mode is one of the symbolic constants POINT, LINE, or FILL. Calling Polygon-
Mode with POINT causes the vertices of a polygon to be treated, for rasterization
purposes, as if they had been drawn with mode POINTS. LINE causes edges to

be rasterized as line segments. FILL is the default mode of polygon rasteriza-
tion, corresponding to the description in sections 3.6.1, and 3.6.2. Note that these
modes affect only the final rasterization of polygons: in particular, a polygon’s ver-
tices are lit, and the polygon is clipped and possibly culled before these modes are
applied.
     Polygon antialiasing applies only to the FILL state of PolygonMode. For
POINT or LINE, point antialiasing or line segment antialiasing, respectively, ap-
ply.

3.6.4    Depth Offset
The depth values of all fragments generated by the rasterization of a polygon may
be offset by a single value that is computed for that polygon. The function that
determines this value is specified by calling

        void PolygonOffset( float factor, float units );

factor scales the maximum depth slope of the polygon, and units scales an
implementation-dependent constant that relates to the usable resolution of the
depth buffer. The resulting values are summed to produce the polygon offset value.
Both factor and units may be either positive or negative.
    The maximum depth slope m of a triangle is

                                            2             2
                                     ∂zw            ∂zw
                           m=                   +                              (3.11)
                                     ∂xw            ∂yw

where (xw , yw , zw ) is a point on the triangle. m may be approximated as

                                         ∂zw   ∂zw
                           m = max           ,            .                    (3.12)
                                         ∂xw   ∂yw

    The minimum resolvable difference r is an implementation-dependent param-
eter that depends on the depth buffer representation. It is the smallest difference in
window coordinate z values that is guaranteed to remain distinct throughout poly-
gon rasterization and in the depth buffer. All pairs of fragments generated by the
rasterization of two polygons with otherwise identical vertices, but zw values that
differ by r, will have distinct depth values.
    For fixed-point depth buffer representations, r is constant throughout the range
of the entire depth buffer. For floating-point depth buffers, there is no single min-
imum resolvable difference. In this case, the minimum resolvable difference for a
given polygon is dependent on the maximum exponent, e, in the range of z values

spanned by the primitive. If n is the number of bits in the floating-point mantissa,
the minimum resolvable difference, r, for the given primitive is defined as

                                     r = 2e−n .
    The offset value o for a polygon is

                          o = m × f actor + r × units.                         (3.13)

m is computed as described above. If the depth buffer uses a fixed-point represen-
tation, m is a function of depth values in the range [0, 1], and o is applied to depth
values in the same range.
     Boolean state values POLYGON_OFFSET_POINT, POLYGON_OFFSET_LINE,
and POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL determine whether o is applied during the rasteriza-
tion of polygons in POINT, LINE, and FILL modes. These boolean state values are
enabled and disabled as argument values to the commands Enable and Disable.
If POLYGON_OFFSET_POINT is enabled, o is added to the depth value of each
fragment produced by the rasterization of a polygon in POINT mode. Likewise,
if POLYGON_OFFSET_LINE or POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL is enabled, o is added to
the depth value of each fragment produced by the rasterization of a polygon in
LINE or FILL modes, respectively.
     For fixed-point depth buffers, fragment depth values are always limited to the
range [0, 1], either by clamping after offset addition is performed (preferred), or by
clamping the vertex values used in the rasterization of the polygon. Fragment depth
values are clamped even when the depth buffer uses a floating-point representation.

3.6.5   Polygon Multisample Rasterization
If MULTISAMPLE is enabled and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, then poly-
gons are rasterized using the following algorithm, regardless of whether polygon
antialiasing (POLYGON_SMOOTH) is enabled or disabled. Polygon rasterization pro-
duces a fragment for each framebuffer pixel with one or more sample points that
satisfy the point sampling criteria described in section 3.6.1. If a polygon is
culled, based on its orientation and the CullFace mode, then no fragments are pro-
duced during rasterization.
    Coverage bits that correspond to sample points that satisfy the point sampling
criteria are 1, other coverage bits are 0. Each associated datum is produced as
described in section 3.6.1, but using the corresponding sample location instead of
the fragment center. An implementation may choose to assign the same associated
data values to more than one sample by barycentric evaluation using any location
within the pixel including the fragment center or one of the sample locations.

    When using a vertex shader, the noperspective and flat qualifiers affect
how varying shader outputs are interpolated in the same fashion as described for
for basic polygon rasterization in section 3.6.1.
    The rasterization described above applies only to the FILL state of Polygon-
Mode. For POINT and LINE, the rasterizations described in sections 3.4.3 (Point
Multisample Rasterization) and 3.5.4 (Line Multisample Rasterization) apply.

3.6.6    Polygon Rasterization State
The state required for polygon rasterization consists of the current state of polygon
antialiasing (enabled or disabled), the current values of the PolygonMode setting,
whether point, line, and fill mode polygon offsets are enabled or disabled, and
the factor and bias values of the polygon offset equation. The initial setting of
polygon antialiasing is disabled. The initial state for PolygonMode is FILL . The
initial polygon offset factor and bias values are both 0; initially polygon offset is
disabled for all modes.


3.7     Pixel Rectangles
Rectangles of color, depth, and certain other values may be specified to the GL
using TexImage*D (see section 3.8.3). Some of the parameters and operations
governing the operation of these commands are shared by ReadPixels (used to
obtain pixel values from the framebuffer); the discussion of ReadPixels, how-
ever, is deferred until chapter 4 after the framebuffer has been discussed in detail.
Nevertheless, we note in this section when parameters and state pertaining to these
commands also pertain to ReadPixels.
    A number of parameters control the encoding of pixels in buffer object or client
memory (for reading and writing) and how pixels are processed before being placed
in or after being read from the framebuffer (for reading, writing, and copying).
These parameters are set with PixelStore.

3.7.1    Pixel Storage Modes and Pixel Buffer Objects
Pixel storage modes affect the operation of TexImage*D, TexSubImage*D, and
ReadPixels when one of these commands is issued. Pixel storage modes are set
with
        void PixelStore{if}( enum pname, T param );
pname is a symbolic constant indicating a parameter to be set, and param is the
value to set it to. Table 3.1 summarizes the pixel storage parameters, their types,

their initial values, and their allowable ranges. Setting a parameter to a value out-
side the given range results in the error INVALID_VALUE.
     The version of PixelStore that takes a floating-point value may be used to
set any type of parameter; if the parameter is boolean, then it is set to FALSE if
the passed value is 0.0 and TRUE otherwise, while if the parameter is an integer,
then the passed value is rounded to the nearest integer. The integer version of
the command may also be used to set any type of parameter; if the parameter is
boolean, then it is set to FALSE if the passed value is 0 and TRUE otherwise, while
if the parameter is a floating-point value, then the passed value is converted to
floating-point.
     In addition to storing pixel data in client memory, pixel data may also be
stored in buffer objects (described in section 2.9). The current pixel unpack and
pack buffer objects are designated by the PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER and PIXEL_-
PACK_BUFFER targets respectively.
     Initially, zero is bound for the PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, indicating that im-
age specification commands such as TexImage*D source their pixels from client
memory pointer parameters. However, if a non-zero buffer object is bound as the
current pixel unpack buffer, then the pointer parameter is treated as an offset into
the designated buffer object.

3.7.2   Transfer of Pixel Rectangles

which they occur.
    Commands accepting or returning pixel rectangles take the following argu-
ments (as well as additional arguments specific to their function):
    format is a symbolic constant indicating what the values in memory represent.
    width and height are the width and height, respectively, of the pixel rectangle
to be transferred.
    data refers to the data to be drawn. These data are represented with one of
several GL data types, specified by type. The correspondence between the type
token values and the GL data types they indicate is given in table 3.2.
    Not all combinations of format and type are valid. If format is DEPTH_-
STENCIL and type is not UNSIGNED_INT_24_8 or FLOAT_32_UNSIGNED_-
INT_24_8_REV, then the error INVALID_ENUM occurs. If format is one of the
integer component formats as defined in table 3.3 and type is FLOAT, the error
INVALID_ENUM occurs. Some additional constraints on the combinations of for-
mat and type values that are accepted are discussed below. Additional restrictions
may be imposed by specific commands.

Table 3.3: Pixel data formats. The second column gives a description of and the
number and order of elements in a group. Unless specified as an index, formats
yield components. Components are floating-point unless prefixed with the letter
’i’, which indicates they are integer.



Unpacking
Data are taken from the currently bound pixel unpack buffer or client memory as a
sequence of signed or unsigned bytes (GL data types byte and ubyte), signed or
unsigned short integers (GL data types short and ushort), signed or unsigned
integers (GL data types int and uint), or floating point values (GL data types
half and float). These elements are grouped into sets of one, two, three, or
four values, depending on the format, to form a group. Table 3.3 summarizes the
format of groups obtained from memory; it also indicates those formats that yield
indices and those that yield floating-point or integer components.
    If a pixel unpack buffer is bound (as indicated by a non-zero value of PIXEL_-
UNPACK_BUFFER_BINDING), data is an offset into the pixel unpack buffer and

Table 3.4: Bit ordering modification of elements when UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES is

and then only for GL data types with 8, 16, or 32 bits. Bit 0 is the least significant.



the pixels are unpacked from the buffer relative to this offset; otherwise, data is a
pointer to client memory and the pixels are unpacked from client memory relative
to the pointer. If a pixel unpack buffer object is bound and unpacking the pixel data
according to the process described below would access memory beyond the size of
the pixel unpack buffer’s memory size, an INVALID_OPERATION error results. If a
pixel unpack buffer object is bound and data is not evenly divisible by the number
of basic machine units needed to store in memory the corresponding GL data type
from table 3.2 for the type parameter (or not evenly divisible by 4 for type FLOAT_-
32_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8_REV, which does not have a corresponding GL data
type), an INVALID_OPERATION error results.
     By default the values of each GL data type are interpreted as they would be
specified in the language of the client’s GL binding. If UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES is
enabled, however, then the values are interpreted with the bit orderings modified
as per table 3.4. The modified bit orderings are defined only if the GL data type
ubyte has eight bits, and then for each specific GL data type only if that type is
represented with 8, 16, or 32 bits.
     The groups in memory are treated as being arranged in a rectangle. This rect-
angle consists of a series of rows, with the first element of the first group of the
first row pointed to by data. If the value of UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH is not positive,
then the number of groups in a row is width; otherwise the number of groups is
UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH. If p indicates the location in memory of the first element
of the first row, then the first element of the N th row is indicated by

the row, a is the value of UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, and s is the size, in units of GL
ubytes, of an element. If the number of bits per element is not 1, 2, 4, or 8 times
the number of bits in a GL ubyte, then k = nl for all values of a.
    There is a mechanism for selecting a sub-rectangle of groups from a
larger containing rectangle. This mechanism relies on three integer parameters:
UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH, UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS, and UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS. Be-
fore obtaining the first group from memory, the data pointer is advanced by
(UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS)n + (UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS)k elements. Then width
groups are obtained from contiguous elements in memory (without advancing the
pointer), after which the pointer is advanced by k elements. height sets of width
groups of values are obtained this way. See figure 3.5.

Special Interpretations
    A type matching one of the types in table 3.5 is a special case in which all
the components of each group are packed into a single unsigned byte, unsigned
short, or unsigned int, depending on the type. If type is FLOAT_32_UNSIGNED_-
INT_24_8_REV, the components of each group are contained within two 32-bit
words; the first word contains the float component, and the second word contains
a packed 24-bit unused field, followed by an 8-bit component. The number of
components per packed pixel is fixed by the type, and must match the number of
components per group indicated by the format parameter, as listed in table 3.5.
The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated by any command processing pixel

rectangles if a mismatch occurs.
     Bitfield locations of the first, second, third, and fourth components of each
packed pixel type are illustrated in tables 3.6- 3.9. Each bitfield is interpreted as
an unsigned integer value. If the base GL type is supported with more than the
minimum precision (e.g. a 9-bit byte) the packed components are right-justified in
the pixel.
     Components are normally packed with the first component in the most signif-
icant bits of the bitfield, and successive component occupying progressively less
significant locations. Types whose token names end with _REV reverse the compo-
nent packing order from least to most significant locations. In all cases, the most
significant bit of each component is packed in the most significant bit location of
its location in the bitfield.

    The assignment of component to fields in the packed pixel is as described in
table 3.10.
    Byte swapping, if enabled, is performed before the components are extracted
from each pixel. The above discussions of row length and image extraction are
valid for packed pixels, if “group” is substituted for “component” and the number
of components per group is understood to be one.
    A type of UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV and format of RGB is a special
case in which the data are a series of GL uint values. Each uint value specifies 3
packed components as shown in table 3.8. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd components are
called fred (11 bits), fgreen (11 bits), and fblue (10 bits) respectively.
    fred and fgreen are treated as unsigned 11-bit floating-point values and con-
verted to floating-point red and green components respectively as described in sec-
tion 2.1.3. fblue is treated as an unsigned 10-bit floating-point value and converted
to a floating-point blue component as described in section 2.1.4.
    A type of UNSIGNED_INT_5_9_9_9_REV and format of RGB is a special case
in which the data are a series of GL uint values. Each uint value specifies 4
packed components as shown in table 3.8. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th components
are called pred , pgreen , pblue , and pexp respectively and are treated as unsigned
integers. These are then used to compute floating-point RGB components (ignoring
the “Conversion to floating-point” section below in this case) as follows:


                               red = pred 2pexp −B−N
                            green = pgreen 2pexp −B−N
                              blue = pblue 2pexp −B−N

    where B = 15 (the exponent bias) and N = 9 (the number of mantissa bits).

Conversion to floating-point
This step applies only to groups of floating-point components. It is not performed
on indices or integer components. For groups containing both components and
indices, such as DEPTH_STENCIL, the indices are not converted.
    Each element in a group is converted to a floating-point value. For unsigned
integer elements, equation 2.1 is used. For signed integer elements, equation 2.2
is used unless the final destination of the transferred element is a texture or frame-
buffer component in one of the SNORM formats described in table 3.12, in which
case equation 2.3 is used instead.

Final Expansion to RGBA
This step is performed only for non-depth component groups. Each group is con-
verted to a group of 4 elements as follows: if a group does not contain an A ele-
ment, then A is added and set to 1 for integer components or 1.0 for floating-point
components. If any of R, G, or B is missing from the group, each missing element
is added and assigned a value of 0 for integer components or 0.0 for floating-point
components.


3.8    Texturing
Texturing maps a portion of one or more specified images onto a fragment or
vertex. This mapping is accomplished in shaders by sampling the color of an
image at the location indicated by specified (s, t, r) texture coordinates. Texture
lookups are typically used to modify a fragment’s RGBA color but may be used
for any purpose in a shader.
     The internal data type of a texture may be signed or unsigned normalized fixed-
point, signed or unsigned integer, or floating-point, depending on the internal for-
mat of the texture. The correspondence between the internal format and the internal
data type is given in tables 3.12-3.13. Fixed-point and floating-point textures return
a floating-point value and integer textures return signed or unsigned integer values.
The fragment shader is responsible for interpreting the result of a texture lookup as
the correct data type, otherwise the result is undefined.
     Each of the supported types of texture is a collection of images built from
one-, two-, or three-dimensional arrays of image elements referred to as texels.
One-, two-, and three-dimensional textures consist respectively of one-, two-, or
three-dimensional texel arrays. One- and two-dimensional array textures are ar-
rays of one- or two-dimensional images, consisting of one or more layers. Two-
dimensional multisample and two-dimensional multisample array textures are spe-

cial two-dimensional and two-dimensional array textures, respectively, containing
multiple samples in each texel. Cube maps are special two-dimensional array tex-
tures with six layers that represent the faces of a cube. When accessing a cube map,
the texture coordinates are projected onto one of the six faces of the cube. Rect-
angular textures are special two-dimensional textures consisting of only a single
image and accessed using unnormalized coordinates. Buffer textures are special
one-dimensional textures whose texel arrays are stored in separate buffer objects.
    Implementations must support texturing using multiple images. The following
subsections (up to and including section 3.8.11) specify the GL operation with a
single texture. The process by which multiple texture images may be sampled and
combined by the application-supplied vertex and fragment shaders is described in
sections 2.11 and 3.9.
    The coordinates used for texturing in a fragment shader are defined by the
OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
    The command

        void ActiveTexture( enum texture );

specifies the active texture unit selector, ACTIVE_TEXTURE. Each texture image
unit consists of all the texture state defined in section 3.8.
     The active texture unit selector selects the texture image unit accessed by com-
mands involving texture image processing. Such commands include TexParam-
eter, TexImage, BindTexture, and queries of all such state.
     ActiveTexture generates the error INVALID_ENUM if an invalid texture is spec-
ified. texture is a symbolic constant of the form TEXTUREi, indicating that texture
unit i is to be modified. The constants obey TEXTUREi = TEXTURE0 + i (i is in the
range 0 to k − 1, where k is the value of MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_-
UNITS).
     The state required for the active texture image unit selector is a single integer.
The initial value is TEXTURE0.

3.8.1    Texture Objects
Textures in GL are represented by named objects. The name space for texture ob-
jects is the unsigned integers, with zero reserved by the GL to represent the default
texture object. The default texture object is bound to each of the TEXTURE_-
1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_3D, TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY,
TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, TEXTURE_BUFFER, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, TEXTURE_-
2D_MULTISAMPLE, and TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY targets during con-
text initialization.

    A new texture object is created by binding an unused name to one of these
texture targets. The command

      void GenTextures( sizei n, uint *textures );;

returns n previously unused texture names in textures. These names are marked
as used, for the purposes of GenTextures only, but they acquire texture state and
a dimensionality only when they are first bound, just as if they were unused. The
binding is effected by calling

      void BindTexture( enum target, uint texture );

with target set to the desired texture target and texture set to the unused name. The
resulting texture object is a new state vector, comprising all the state and with the
same initial values listed in section 3.8.15 The new texture object bound to target
is, and remains a texture of the dimensionality and type specified by target until it
is deleted.
     BindTexture may also be used to bind an existing texture object to any of
these targets. The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if an attempt is made
to bind a texture object of different dimensionality than the specified target. If the
bind is successful no change is made to the state of the bound texture object, and
any previous binding to target is broken.
     BindTexture fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if texture
is not zero or a name returned from a previous call to GenTextures, or if such a
name has since been deleted.
     While a texture object is bound, GL operations on the target to which it is
bound affect the bound object, and queries of the target to which it is bound return
state from the bound object. If texture mapping of the dimensionality of the target
to which a texture object is bound is enabled, the state of the bound texture object
directs the texturing operation.
     Texture objects are deleted by calling

      void DeleteTextures( sizei n, const uint *textures );

textures contains n names of texture objects to be deleted. After a texture object
is deleted, it has no contents or dimensionality, and its name is again unused. If
a texture that is currently bound to any of the target bindings of BindTexture is
deleted, it is as though BindTexture had been executed with the same target and
texture zero. Additionally, special care must be taken when deleting a texture if any
of the images of the texture are attached to a framebuffer object. See section 4.4.2
for details.

    Unused names in textures are silently ignored, as is the name zero.
    The texture object name space, including the initial one-, two-, and three- di-
mensional, one- and two-dimensional array, rectangular, buffer, cube map, two-
dimensional multisample, and two-dimensional multisample array texture objects,
is shared among all texture units. A texture object may be bound to more than one
texture unit simultaneously. After a texture object is bound, any GL operations on
that target object affect any other texture units to which the same texture object is
bound.
    Texture binding is affected by the setting of the state ACTIVE_TEXTURE. If a
texture object is deleted, it as if all texture units which are bound to that texture
object are rebound to texture object zero.

3.8.2    Sampler Objects
The state necessary for texturing can be divided into two categories as described in
section 3.8.15. A GL texture object includes both categories. The first category
represents dimensionality and other image parameters, and the second category
represents sampling state. Additionally, a sampler object may be created to encap-
sulate only the second category - the sampling state - of a texture object.
    A new sampler object is created by binding an unused name to a texture unit.
The command

        void GenSamplers( sizei count, uint *samplers );

returns count previously unused sampler object names in samplers. The name zero
is reserved by the GL to represent no sampler being bound to a sampler unit. The
names are marked as used, for the purposes of GenSamplers only, but they acquire
state only when they are first used as a parameter to BindSampler, SamplerPa-
rameter*, GetSamplerParameter*, or IsSampler. When a sampler object is first
used in one of these functions, the resulting sampler object is initialized with a
new state vector, comprising all the state and with the same initial values listed in
table 6.17.
     When a sampler object is bound to a texture unit, its state supersedes that of
the texture object bound to that texture unit. If the sampler name zero is bound to
a texture unit, the currently bound texture’s sampler state becomes active. A single
sampler object may be bound to multiple texture units simultaneously.
     A sampler binding is effected by calling

        void BindSampler( uint unit, uint sampler );

3.8. TEXTURING                                                                     138


with unit set to the texture unit to which to bind the sampler and sampler set to the
name of a sampler object returned from a previous call to GenSampler.
    If the bind is successful no change is made to the state of the bound sampler
object, and any previous binding to unit is broken.
    BindSampler fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if sampler
is not zero or a name returned from a previous call to GenSamplers, or if such a
name has since been deleted with DeleteSamplers. An INVALID_VALUE error is
generated if unit is greater than or equal to the value of MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_-
UNITS.
    If state is present in a sampler object bound to a texture unit that would have
been rejected by a call to TexParameter for the texture bound to that unit, the be-
havior of the implementation is as if the texture were incomplete. For example, if
TEXTURE_WRAP_S, TEXTURE_WRAP_T, or TEXTURE_WRAP_R is set to REPEAT or
MIRRORED_REPEAT on the sampler object bound to a texture unit and the texture
bound to that unit is a rectangular texture, the texture will be considered incom-
plete.
    The currently bound sampler may be queried by calling GetIntegerv with
pname set to SAMPLER_BINDING. When a sampler object is unbound from the
texture unit (by binding another sampler object, or the sampler object named zero,
to that texture unit) the modified state is again replaced with the sampler state as-
sociated with the texture object bound to that texture unit.
    The parameters represented by a sampler object are a subset of those described
in section 3.8.8. Each parameter of a sampler object is set by calling

      void SamplerParameter{if}v( uint sampler, enum pname,
         T param );
      void SamplerParameterI{u ui}v( uint sampler, enum pname,
         T *params );

sampler is the name of a sampler object previously reserved by a call to
GenSamplers. pname is the name of a parameter to modify and param
is the new value of that parameter. An INVALID_VALUE error is gener-
ated if sampler is not the name of a sampler object previously returned
from a call to GenSamplers. The values accepted in the pname parameter
are TEXTURE_WRAP_S, TEXTURE_WRAP_T, TEXTURE_WRAP_R, TEXTURE_MIN_-
FILTER, TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR, TEXTURE_MIN_-
LOD, TEXTURE_MAX_LOD, TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS, TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE, and
TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC. Texture state listed in table 6.16 but not listed here and
in the sampler state in table 6.17 is not part of the sampler state, and remains in the
texture object.

3.8. TEXTURING                                                                   139


    If the values for TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are specified with a call to Sam-
plerParameterIiv or SamplerParameterIuiv, the values are unmodified and
stored with an internal data type of integer. If specified with SamplerParameteriv,
they are converted to floating-point using equation 2.1. Otherwise, the values are
unmodified and stored as floating-point.
    An INVALID_ENUM error is generated if pname is not the name of a parame-
ter accepted by SamplerParameter*. If the value of param is not an acceptable
value for the parameter specified in pname, an error is generated as specified in the
description of TexParameter*.
    Modifying a parameter of a sampler object affects all texture units to which
that sampler object is bound. Calling TexParameter has no effect on the sampler
object bound to the active texture unit. It will modify the parameters of the texture
object bound to that unit.
    Sampler objects are deleted by calling

        void DeleteSamplers( sizei count, const uint *samplers );

samplers contains count names of sampler objects to be deleted. After a sampler
object is deleted, its name is again unused. If a sampler object that is currently
bound to a sampler unit is deleted, it is as though BindSampler is called with unit
set to the unit the sampler is bound to and sampler zero. Unused names in samplers
are silently ignored, as is the reserved name zero.

3.8.3    Texture Image Specification
The command

        void TexImage3D( enum target, int level, int internalformat,
           sizei width, sizei height, sizei depth, int border,
           enum format, enum type, const void *data );

is used to specify a three-dimensional texture image. target must be one of
TEXTURE_3D for a three-dimensional texture or TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY for an two-
dimensional array texture. Additionally, target may be either PROXY_TEXTURE_-
3D for a three-dimensional proxy texture, or PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY for a
two-dimensional proxy array texture, as discussed in section 3.8.15. format, type,
and data specify the format of the image data, the type of those data, and a refer-
ence to the image data in the currently bound pixel unpack buffer or client memory,
as described in section 3.7.2. The format STENCIL_INDEX is not allowed.

3.8. TEXTURING                                                                   140


     The groups in memory are treated as being arranged in a sequence of adjacent
rectangles. Each rectangle is a two-dimensional image, whose size and organiza-
tion are specified by the width and height parameters to TexImage3D. The val-
ues of UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH and UNPACK_ALIGNMENT control the row-to-row
spacing in these images as described in section 3.7.2. If the value of the integer
parameter UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT is not positive, then the number of rows in
each two-dimensional image is height; otherwise the number of rows is UNPACK_-
IMAGE_HEIGHT. Each two-dimensional image comprises an integral number of
rows, and is exactly adjacent to its neighbor images.
     The mechanism for selecting a sub-volume of a three-dimensional image relies
on the integer parameter UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES. If UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES is
positive, the pointer is advanced by UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES times the number of
elements in one two-dimensional image before obtaining the first group from mem-
ory. Then depth two-dimensional images are processed, each having a subimage
extracted as described in section 3.7.2.
     The selected groups are transferred to the GL as described in section 3.7.2
and then clamped to the representable range of the internal format. If the inter-
nalformat of the texture is signed or unsigned integer, components are clamped
to [−2n−1 , 2n−1 − 1] or [0, 2n − 1], respectively, where n is the number of bits
per component. For color component groups, if the internalformat of the texture
is signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point, components are clamped to [−1, 1]
or [0, 1], respectively. For depth component groups, the depth value is clamped
to [0, 1]. Otherwise, values are not modified. Stencil index values are masked by
2n − 1, where n is the number of stencil bits in the internal format resolution (see
below). If the base internal format is DEPTH_STENCIL and format is not DEPTH_-
STENCIL, then the values of the stencil index texture components are undefined.
     Components are then selected from the resulting R, G, B, A, depth, or stencil
values to obtain a texture with the base internal format specified by (or derived
from) internalformat. Table 3.11 summarizes the mapping of R, G, B, A, depth,
or stencil values to texture components, as a function of the base internal format
of the texture image. internalformat may be specified as one of the internal format
symbolic constants listed in table 3.11, as one of the sized internal format symbolic
constants listed in tables 3.12- 3.13, as one of the generic compressed internal
format symbolic constants listed in table 3.14, or as one of the specific compressed
internal format symbolic constants (if listed in table 3.14). Specifying a value for
internalformat that is not one of the above values generates the error INVALID_-
VALUE.
     Textures with a base internal format of DEPTH_COMPONENT or DEPTH_-
STENCIL are supported by texture image specification commands only
if target is TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_-

2D_ARRAY, PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP. Us-
ing these formats in conjunction with any other target will result in an INVALID_-
OPERATION error.
    Textures with a base internal format of DEPTH_COMPONENT or DEPTH_-
STENCIL require either depth component data or depth/stencil component data.
Textures with other base internal formats require RGBA component data. The error
INVALID_OPERATION is generated if one of the base internal format and format is
DEPTH_COMPONENT or DEPTH_STENCIL, and the other is neither of these values.
    Textures with integer internal formats (see table 3.12) require integer data.
The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the internal format is integer and
format is not one of the integer formats listed in table 3.3; if the internal format is
not integer and format is an integer format; or if format is an integer format and type
is FLOAT, HALF_FLOAT, UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV, or UNSIGNED_-
INT_5_9_9_9_REV.
    In addition to the specific compressed internal formats listed in table 3.14, the
GL provides a mechanism to obtain token values for all such formats provided
by extensions. The number of specific compressed internal formats supported
by the renderer can be obtained by querying the value of NUM_COMPRESSED_-
TEXTURE_FORMATS. The set of specific compressed internal formats supported by
the renderer can be obtained by querying the value of COMPRESSED_TEXTURE_-
FORMATS. The only values returned by this query are those corresponding to for-
mats suitable for general-purpose usage. The renderer will not enumerate formats
with restrictions that need to be specifically understood prior to use.

3.8. TEXTURING                                                                    142


    Generic compressed internal formats are never used directly as the internal for-
mats of texture images. If internalformat is one of the six generic compressed
internal formats, its value is replaced by the symbolic constant for a specific com-
pressed internal format of the GL’s choosing with the same base internal format.
If no specific compressed format is available, internalformat is instead replaced by
the corresponding base internal format. If internalformat is given as or mapped
to a specific compressed internal format, but the GL can not support images com-
pressed in the chosen internal format for any reason (e.g., the compression format
might not support 3D textures), internalformat is replaced by the corresponding
base internal format and the texture image will not be compressed by the GL.
    The internal component resolution is the number of bits allocated to each value
in a texture image. If internalformat is specified as a base internal format, the GL
stores the resulting texture with internal component resolutions of its own choos-
ing. If a sized internal format is specified, the mapping of the R, G, B, A, depth,
and stencil values to texture components is equivalent to the mapping of the cor-
responding base internal format’s components, as specified in table 3.11; the type
(unsigned int, float, etc.) is assigned the same type specified by internalformat;
and the memory allocation per texture component is assigned by the GL to match
the allocations listed in tables 3.12- 3.13 as closely as possible. (The definition of
closely is left up to the implementation. However, a non-zero number of bits must
be allocated for each component whose desired allocation in tables 3.12- 3.13 is
non-zero, and zero bits must be allocated for all other components).

Required Texture Formats
Implementations are required to support at least one allocation of internal com-
ponent resolution for each type (unsigned int, float, etc.) for each base internal
format.
   In addition, implementations are required to support the following sized and
compressed internal formats. Requesting one of these sized internal formats for
any texture type will allocate at least the internal component sizes, and exactly the
component types shown for that format in tables 3.12- 3.13:
   • Texture and renderbuffer color formats (see section 4.4.2).
         – RGBA32F, RGBA32I, RGBA32UI, RGBA16, RGBA16F, RGBA16I,
           RGBA16UI, RGBA8, RGBA8I, RGBA8UI, SRGB8_ALPHA8, RGB10_A2,
           and RGB10_A2UI.
         – R11F_G11F_B10F.
         – RG32F, RG32I, RG32UI, RG16, RG16F, RG16I, RG16UI, RG8, RG8I,
           and RG8UI.

          – R32F, R32I, R32UI, R16F, R16I, R16UI, R16, R8, R8I, and R8UI.

   • Texture-only color formats:

          – RGBA16_SNORM and RGBA8_SNORM.
          – RGB32F, RGB32I, and RGB32UI.
          – RGB16_SNORM, RGB16F, RGB16I, RGB16UI, and RGB16.

   • Depth formats:   DEPTH_COMPONENT32F, DEPTH_COMPONENT24, and
        DEPTH_COMPONENT16.

   • Combined depth+stencil formats: DEPTH32F_STENCIL8 and DEPTH24_-
     STENCIL8.

Encoding of Special Internal Formats
If internalformat is R11F_G11F_B10F, the red, green, and blue bits are converted
to unsigned 11-bit, unsigned 11-bit, and unsigned 10-bit floating-point values as
described in sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.
     If internalformat is RGB9_E5, the red, green, and blue bits are converted to a
shared exponent format according to the following procedure:
     Components red, green, and blue are first clamped (in the process, mapping
NaN to zero) as follows:


                   redc = max(0, min(sharedexpmax , red))
                greenc = max(0, min(sharedexpmax , green))
                  bluec = max(0, min(sharedexpmax , blue))

where
                                       (2N − 1) Emax −B
                     sharedexpmax =             2         .
                                          2N
N is the number of mantissa bits per component (9), B is the exponent bias (15),
and Emax is the maximum allowed biased exponent value (31).

    The largest clamped component, maxc , is determined:

                        maxc = max(redc , greenc , bluec )
    A preliminary shared exponent expp is computed:

                 expp = max(−B − 1, log2 (maxc ) ) + 1 + B
    A refined shared exponent exps is computed:
                                         maxc
                          maxs =                  + 0.5
                                      2 p −B−N
                                       exp


                                expp ,    0 ≤ maxs < 2N

                                expp + 1, maxs = 2N

    Finally, three integer values in the range 0 to 2N − 1 are computed:


                                         redc
                            reds =                 + 0.5
                                      2 s −B−N
                                       exp
                                        greenc
                          greens =                 + 0.5
                                      2 s −B−N
                                       exp
                                         bluec
                           blues =               + 0.5
                                      2exps −B−N

   The resulting reds , greens , blues , and exps are stored in the red, green, blue,
and shared bits respectively of the texture image.
   An implementation accepting pixel data of type UNSIGNED_INT_5_9_9_9_-
REV with format RGB is allowed to store the components “as is”.

    If a compressed internal format is specified, the mapping of the R, G, B, and
A values to texture components is equivalent to the mapping of the corresponding
base internal format’s components, as specified in table 3.11. The specified image
is compressed using a (possibly lossy) compression algorithm chosen by the GL.

     A GL implementation may vary its allocation of internal component resolution
or compressed internal format based on any TexImage3D, TexImage2D (see be-
low), or TexImage1D (see below) parameter (except target), but the allocation and
chosen compressed image format must not be a function of any other state and can-
not be changed once they are established. In addition, the choice of a compressed
image format may not be affected by the data parameter. Allocations must be in-
variant; the same allocation and compressed image format must be chosen each
time a texture image is specified with the same parameter values. These allocation
rules also apply to proxy textures, which are described in section 3.8.15.
     The image itself (referred to by data) is a sequence of groups of values. The
first group is the lower left back corner of the texture image. Subsequent groups
fill out rows of width width from left to right; height rows are stacked from bottom
to top forming a single two-dimensional image slice; and depth slices are stacked
from back to front. When the final R, G, B, and A components have been computed
for a group, they are assigned to components of a texel as described by table 3.11.
Counting from zero, each resulting N th texel is assigned internal integer coordi-
nates (i, j, k), where

                             i = (N mod width) − wb
                                 N
                         j=(          mod height) − hb
                                width
                                  N
                    k=(                    mod depth) − db
                            width × height
and wb , hb , and db are the specified border width, height, and depth. wb and hb are
the specified border value; db is the specified border value if target is TEXTURE_-
3D, or zero if target is TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY. Thus the last two-dimensional image
slice of the three-dimensional image is indexed with the highest value of k.
    If the internal data type of the image array is signed or unsigned normalized
fixed-point, each color component is converted using equation 2.6 or 2.4, respec-
tively. If the internal type is floating-point or integer, components are clamped
to the representable range of the corresponding internal component, but are not
converted.
    The level argument to TexImage3D is an integer level-of-detail number. Levels
of detail are discussed below, under Mipmapping. The main texture image has a
level of detail number of 0. If a level-of-detail less than zero is specified, the error
INVALID_VALUE is generated.
    The border argument to TexImage3D is a border width. The significance of
borders is described below. The border width affects the dimensions of the texture

image: let


                                   ws = wt + 2wb
                                   hs = ht + 2hb                                 (3.16)
                                    ds = dt + 2db

      where ws , hs , and ds are the specified image width, height, and depth, and wt ,
ht , and dt are the dimensions of the texture image internal to the border. If wt , ht ,
or dt are less than zero, then the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.
      The maximum border width bt is 0. If border is less than zero, or greater than
bt , then the error INVALID_VALUE is generated.
      The maximum allowable width, height, or depth of a texel array for a three-
dimensional texture is an implementation-dependent function of the level-of-detail
and internal format of the resulting image array. It must be at least 2k−lod + 2bt
for image arrays of level-of-detail 0 through k, where k is the log base 2 of MAX_-
3D_TEXTURE_SIZE, lod is the level-of-detail of the image array, and bt is the
maximum border width. It may be zero for image arrays of any level-of-detail
greater than k. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if the specified image is
too large to be stored under any conditions.
      If a pixel unpack buffer object is bound and storing texture data would access
memory beyond the end of the pixel unpack buffer, an INVALID_OPERATION error
results.
      In a similar fashion, the maximum allowable width of a texel array for a one- or
two-dimensional, one- or two-dimensional array, two-dimensional multisample, or
two-dimensional multisample array texture, and the maximum allowable height of
a two-dimensional, two-dimensional array, two-dimensional multisample, or two-
dimensional multisample array texture, must be at least 2k−lod + 2bt for image
arrays of level 0 through k, where k is the log base 2 of MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE. The
maximum allowable width and height of a cube map texture must be the same, and
must be at least 2k−lod + 2bt for image arrays level 0 through k, where k is the log
base 2 of MAX_CUBE_MAP_TEXTURE_SIZE. The maximum number of layers for
one- and two-dimensional array textures (height or depth, respectively) must be at
least MAX_ARRAY_TEXTURE_LAYERS for all levels.
      The maximum allowable width and height of a rectangular texture image
must each be at least the value of the implementation-dependent constant MAX_-
RECTANGLE_TEXTURE_SIZE.
      An implementation may allow an image array of level 0 to be created only if
that single image array can be supported. Additional constraints on the creation of
image arrays of level 1 or greater are described in more detail in section 3.8.14.

   The command

      void TexImage2D( enum target, int level, int internalformat,
         sizei width, sizei height, int border, enum format,
         enum type, const void *data );

is used to specify a two-dimensional texture image. target must be one of
TEXTURE_2D for a two-dimensional texture, TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY for a one-
dimensional array texture, TEXTURE_RECTANGLE for a rectangle texture, or one
of TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_-
X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z, or TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z for
a cube map texture. Additionally, target may be either PROXY_TEXTURE_2D
for a two-dimensional proxy texture, PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY for a one-
dimensional proxy array texture, PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE for a rectangle
proxy texture, or PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP for a cube map proxy texture
in the special case discussed in section 3.8.15. The other parameters match the
corresponding parameters of TexImage3D.
     For the purposes of decoding the texture image, TexImage2D is equivalent to
calling TexImage3D with corresponding arguments and depth of 1, except that
UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES is ignored.
     A two-dimensional or rectangle texture consists of a single two-dimensional
texture image. A cube map texture is a set of six two-dimensional texture im-
ages. The six cube map texture targets form a single cube map texture though
each target names a distinct face of the cube map. The TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_*
targets listed above update their appropriate cube map face 2D texture image. Note
that the six cube map two-dimensional image tokens such as TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP_POSITIVE_X are used when specifying, updating, or querying one of a cube
map’s six two-dimensional images, but when binding to a cube map texture ob-
ject (that is when the cube map is accessed as a whole as opposed to a particular
two-dimensional image), the TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP target is specified.
     When the target parameter to TexImage2D is one of the six cube map two-
dimensional image targets, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated if the width
and height parameters are not equal.
     When target is TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, an INVALID_VALUE error is generated
if level is non-zero.
     An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if border is non-zero.
     Finally, the command

           int internalformat, sizei width, int border,
           enum format, enum type, const void *data );

is used to specify a one-dimensional texture image. target must be either
TEXTURE_1D, or PROXY_TEXTURE_1D in the special case discussed in sec-
tion 3.8.15.
    For the purposes of decoding the texture image, TexImage1D is equivalent to
calling TexImage2D with corresponding arguments and height of 1.
    The image indicated to the GL by the image pointer is decoded and copied into
the GL’s internal memory.
    We shall refer to the decoded image as the texel array. A three-dimensional
texel array has width, height, and depth ws , hs , and ds as defined in equation 3.16.
A two-dimensional or rectangular texel array has depth ds = 1, with height hs
and width ws as above. A one-dimensional texel array has depth ds = 1, height
hs = 1, and width ws as above.
    An element (i, j, k) of the texel array is called a texel (for a two-dimensional
texture or one-dimensional array texture, k is irrelevant; for a one-dimensional
texture, j and k are both irrelevant). The texture value used in texturing a fragment
is determined by sampling the texture in a shader, but may not correspond to any
actual texel. See figure 3.6.
    If the data argument of TexImage1D, TexImage2D, or TexImage3D is a null
pointer (a zero-valued pointer in the C implementation), and the pixel unpack
buffer object is zero, a one-, two-, or three-dimensional texel array is created with
the specified target, level, internalformat, border, width, height, and depth, but
with unspecified image contents. In this case no pixel values are accessed in client
memory, and no pixel processing is performed. Errors are generated, however, ex-
actly as though the data pointer were valid. Otherwise if the pixel unpack buffer
object is non-zero, the data argument is treatedly normally to refer to the beginning
of the pixel unpack buffer object’s data.

3.8.4    Alternate Texture Image Specification Commands
Two-dimensional and one-dimensional texture images may also be specified us-
ing image data taken directly from the framebuffer, and rectangular subregions of
existing texture images may be respecified.
    The command

        void CopyTexImage2D( enum target, int level,
           enum internalformat, int x, int y, sizei width,
           sizei height, int border );

defines a two-dimensional texel array in exactly the manner of TexImage2D, ex-
cept that the image data are taken from the framebuffer rather than from client
memory. Currently, target must be one of TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,
TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP_NEGATIVE_X,                                 TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_-
Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z, or
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z. x, y, width, and height correspond precisely
to the corresponding arguments to ReadPixels (refer to section 4.3.1); they specify
the image’s width and height, and the lower left (x, y) coordinates of the frame-
buffer region to be copied. The image is taken from the framebuffer exactly as
if these arguments were passed to ReadPixels with argument type set to COLOR,
DEPTH, or DEPTH_STENCIL, depending on internalformat, stopping after con-
version of depth values.      RGBA data is taken from the current color buffer,
while depth component and stencil index data are taken from the depth and sten-
cil buffers, respectively. The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if depth
component data is required and no depth buffer is present; if stencil index data is
required and no stencil buffer is present; if integer RGBA data is required and the
format of the current color buffer is not integer; or if floating- or fixed-point RGBA
data is required and the format of the current color buffer is integer.
     Subsequent processing is identical to that described for TexImage2D, begin-
ning with clamping of the R, G, B, A, or depth values, and masking of the stencil
index values from the resulting pixel groups. Parameters level, internalformat, and
border are specified using the same values, with the same meanings, as the equiv-
alent arguments of TexImage2D. An invalid value specified for internalformat
generates the error INVALID_ENUM. The constraints on width, height, and border
are exactly those for the equivalent arguments of TexImage2D.
     When the target parameter to CopyTexImage2D is one of the six cube map
two-dimensional image targets, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated if the width
and height parameters are not equal.
     An INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error will be generated if the ob-
ject bound to READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING (see section 4.4) is not framebuffer
complete (as defined in section 4.4.4). An INVALID_OPERATION error will be
generated if the object bound to READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is framebuffer
complete and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is greater than zero.
     The command

      void CopyTexImage1D( enum target, int level,
         enum internalformat, int x, int y, sizei width,
         int border );

defines a one-dimensional texel array in exactly the manner of TexImage1D, ex-
cept that the image data are taken from the framebuffer, rather than from client
memory. Currently, target must be TEXTURE_1D. For the purposes of decoding
the texture image, CopyTexImage1D is equivalent to calling CopyTexImage2D
with corresponding arguments and height of 1, except that the height of the image
is always 1, regardless of the value of border. level, internalformat, and border are
specified using the same values, with the same meanings, as the equivalent argu-
ments of TexImage1D. The constraints on width and border are exactly those of
the equivalent arguments of TexImage1D.
     Six additional commands,
      void TexSubImage3D( enum target, int level, int xoffset,
         int yoffset, int zoffset, sizei width, sizei height,
         sizei depth, enum format, enum type, const

      void TexSubImage1D( enum target, int level, int xoffset,

      void CopyTexSubImage3D( enum target, int level,

      void CopyTexSubImage2D( enum target, int level,
         int xoffset, int yoffset, int x, int y, sizei width,

      void CopyTexSubImage1D( enum target, int level,
         int xoffset, int x, int y, sizei width );
respecify only a rectangular subregion of an existing texel array. No change is
made to the internalformat, width, height, depth, or border parameters of the
specified texel array, nor is any change made to texel values outside the speci-
fied subregion. Currently the target arguments of TexSubImage1D and CopyTex-
SubImage1D must be TEXTURE_1D, the target arguments of TexSubImage2D
and CopyTexSubImage2D must be one of TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,
TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP_NEGATIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP_NEGATIVE_Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z, or TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP_NEGATIVE_Z, and the target arguments of TexSubImage3D and CopyTex-
SubImage3D must be TEXTURE_3D or TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY. The level parameter

of each command specifies the level of the texel array that is modified. If level is
less than zero or greater than the base 2 logarithm of the maximum texture width,
height, or depth, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated. If target is TEXTURE_-
RECTANGLE and level is not zero, the error INVALID_VALUE is generated. Tex-
SubImage3D arguments width, height, depth, format, type, and data match the
corresponding arguments to TexImage3D, meaning that they are specified using
the same values, and have the same meanings. Likewise, TexSubImage2D argu-
ments width, height, format, type, and data match the corresponding arguments
to TexImage2D, and TexSubImage1D arguments width, format, type, and data
match the corresponding arguments to TexImage1D.
    CopyTexSubImage3D and CopyTexSubImage2D arguments x, y, width,
and height match the corresponding arguments to CopyTexImage2D1 . CopyTex-
SubImage1D arguments x, y, and width match the corresponding arguments to
CopyTexImage1D. Each of the TexSubImage commands interprets and processes
pixel groups in exactly the manner of its TexImage counterpart, except that the as-
signment of R, G, B, A, depth, and stencil index pixel group values to the texture
components is controlled by the internalformat of the texel array, not by an argu-
ment to the command. The same constraints and errors apply to the TexSubImage
commands’ argument format and the internalformat of the texel array being re-
specified as apply to the format and internalformat arguments of its TexImage
counterparts.
    Arguments xoffset, yoffset, and zoffset of TexSubImage3D and CopyTex-
SubImage3D specify the lower left texel coordinates of a width-wide by height-
high by depth-deep rectangular subregion of the texel array. The depth argument
associated with CopyTexSubImage3D is always 1, because framebuffer memory
is two-dimensional - only a portion of a single s, t slice of a three-dimensional
texture is replaced by CopyTexSubImage3D.
    Negative values of xoffset, yoffset, and zoffset correspond to the coordinates
of border texels, addressed as in figure 3.6. Taking ws , hs , ds , wb , hb , and db to
be the specified width, height, depth, and border width, border height, and border
depth of the texel array, and taking x, y, z, w, h, and d to be the xoffset, yoffset,
zoffset, width, height, and depth argument values, any of the following relationships
generates the error INVALID_VALUE:

                                       x < −wb
                                  x + w > w s − wb

    Because the framebuffer is inherently two-dimensional, there is no CopyTexImage3D com-
mand.

     Texture images with compressed internal formats may be stored in such a way
that it is not possible to modify an image with subimage commands without having
to decompress and recompress the texture image. Even if the image were modi-
fied in this manner, it may not be possible to preserve the contents of some of
the texels outside the region being modified. To avoid these complications, the
GL does not support arbitrary modifications to texture images with compressed
internal formats. Calling TexSubImage3D, CopyTexSubImage3D, TexSubIm-
age2D, CopyTexSubImage2D, TexSubImage1D, or CopyTexSubImage1D will
result in an INVALID_OPERATION error if xoffset, yoffset, or zoffset is not equal to
−bs (border width). In addition, the contents of any texel outside the region mod-
ified by such a call are undefined. These restrictions may be relaxed for specific
compressed internal formats whose images are easily modified.
     If the internal format of the texture image being modified is one of the spe-
cific RGTC formats described in table 3.14, the texture is stored using one of the
RGTC texture image encodings (see appendix C.1). Since RGTC images are easily
edited along 4 × 4 texel boundaries, the limitations on subimage location and size
are relaxed for TexSubImage2D, TexSubImage3D, CopyTexSubImage2D, and
CopyTexSubImage3D. These commands will generate an INVALID_OPERATION
error if one of the following conditions occurs:

   • width is not a multiple of four, width + xoffset is not equal to the value of
     TEXTURE_WIDTH, and either xoffset or yoffset is non-zero.

   • height is not a multiple of four, height + yoffset is not equal to the value of
     TEXTURE_HEIGHT, and either xoffset or yoffset is non-zero.

   • xoffset or yoffset is not a multiple of four.

   The contents of any 4 × 4 block of texels of an RGTC compressed texture
image that does not intersect the area being modified are preserved during valid
TexSubImage* and CopyTexSubImage* calls.

   Calling CopyTexSubImage3D, CopyTexImage2D, CopyTexSubImage2D,
CopyTexImage1D, or CopyTexSubImage1D will result in an INVALID_-
FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error if the object bound to READ_FRAMEBUFFER_-
BINDING is not framebuffer complete (see section 4.4.4).

Texture Copying Feedback Loops
Calling CopyTexSubImage3D, CopyTexImage2D, CopyTexSubImage2D,
CopyTexImage1D, or CopyTexSubImage1D will result in undefined behavior if
the destination texture image level is also bound to to the selected read buffer (see
section 4.3.1) of the read framebuffer. This situation is discussed in more detail in
the description of feedback loops in section 4.4.3.

3.8.5    Compressed Texture Images
Texture images may also be specified or modified using image data already stored
in a known compressed image format, such as the RGTC formats defined in ap-
pendix C, or additional formats defined by GL extensions.
    The commands

        void CompressedTexImage1D( enum target, int level,
           enum internalformat, sizei width, int border,
           sizei imageSize, const void *data );
        void CompressedTexImage2D( enum target, int level,
           enum internalformat, sizei width, sizei height,
           int border, sizei imageSize, const void *data );
        void CompressedTexImage3D( enum target, int level,
           enum internalformat, sizei width, sizei height,
           sizei depth, int border, sizei imageSize, const
           void *data );

define one-, two-, and three-dimensional texture images, respectively, with incom-
ing data stored in a specific compressed image format. The target, level, inter-
nalformat, width, height, depth, and border parameters have the same meaning
as in TexImage1D, TexImage2D, and TexImage3D, except that compressed rect-
angular texture formats are not supported. data refers to compressed image data
stored in the specific compressed image format corresponding to internalformat.
If a pixel unpack buffer is bound (as indicated by a non-zero value of PIXEL_-
UNPACK_BUFFER_BINDING), data is an offset into the pixel unpack buffer and the
compressed data is read from the buffer relative to this offset; otherwise, data is

a pointer to client memory and the compressed data is read from client memory
relative to the pointer.
    If the target parameter to any of the CompressedTexImagenD commands is
TEXTURE_RECTANGLE or PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, the error INVALID_-
ENUM is generated.
    internalformat must be a supported specific compressed internal format. An
INVALID_ENUM error will be generated if any other values, including any of the
generic compressed internal formats, is specified.
    For all other compressed internal formats, the compressed image will be de-
coded according to the specification defining the internalformat token. Com-
pressed texture images are treated as an array of imageSize ubytes relative to
data. If a pixel unpack buffer object is bound and data + imageSize is greater
than the size of the pixel buffer, an INVALID_OPERATION error results. All pixel
storage modes are ignored when decoding a compressed texture image. If the im-
ageSize parameter is not consistent with the format, dimensions, and contents of
the compressed image, an INVALID_VALUE error results. If the compressed image
is not encoded according to the defined image format, the results of the call are
undefined.
    Specific compressed internal formats may impose format-specific restrictions
on the use of the compressed image specification calls or parameters. For example,
the compressed image format might be supported only for 2D textures, or might
not allow non-zero border values. Any such restrictions will be documented in the
extension specification defining the compressed internal format; violating these
restrictions will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error.
    Any restrictions imposed by specific compressed internal formats will be in-
variant, meaning that if the GL accepts and stores a texture image in compressed
form, providing the same image to CompressedTexImage1D, Compressed-
TexImage2D, or CompressedTexImage3D will not result in an INVALID_-
OPERATION error if the following restrictions are satisfied:

   • data points to a compressed texture image returned by GetCompressedTex-
     Image (section 6.1.4).

   • target, level, and internalformat match the target, level and format parame-
     ters provided to the GetCompressedTexImage call returning data.

   • width, height, depth, internalformat, and imageSize match the values
     of TEXTURE_WIDTH, TEXTURE_HEIGHT, TEXTURE_DEPTH, TEXTURE_-
     INTERNAL_FORMAT, and TEXTURE_COMPRESSED_IMAGE_SIZE for image
     level level in effect at the time of the GetCompressedTexImage call return-
     ing data.

This guarantee applies not just to images returned by GetCompressedTexImage,
but also to any other properly encoded compressed texture image of the same size
and format.
    If internalformat is one of the specific RGTC formats described in table 3.14,
the compressed image data is stored using one of the RGTC compressed texture
image encodings (see appendix C.1) The RGTC texture compression algorithm
supports only two-dimensional images without borders. If internalformat is an
RGTC format, CompressedTexImage1D will generate an INVALID_ENUM error;
CompressedTexImage2D will generate an INVALID_OPERATION error if bor-
der is non-zero or target is TEXTURE_RECTANGLE; and CompressedTexImage3D
will generate an INVALID_OPERATION error if border is non-zero or target is not
TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY.
    If the data argument of CompressedTexImage1D, CompressedTexImage2D,
or CompressedTexImage3D is a null pointer (a zero-valued pointer in the C imple-
mentation), and the pixel unpack buffer object is zero, a texel array with unspeci-
fied image contents is created, just as when a null pointer is passed to TexImage1D,
TexImage2D, or TexImage3D.

         int xoffset, sizei width, enum format, sizei imageSize,

         enum format, sizei imageSize, const void *data );
      void CompressedTexSubImage3D( enum target, int level,
         int xoffset, int yoffset, int zoffset, sizei width,
         sizei height, sizei depth, enum format,

respecify only a rectangular region of an existing texel array, with incoming data
stored in a known compressed image format. The target, level, xoffset, yoffset, zoff-
set, width, height, and depth parameters have the same meaning as in TexSubIm-
age1D, TexSubImage2D, and TexSubImage3D. data points to compressed image
data stored in the compressed image format corresponding to format. Using any of
the generic compressed internal formats as format will result in an INVALID_ENUM
error.
     If the target parameter to any of the CompressedTexSubImagenD com-
mands is TEXTURE_RECTANGLE or PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, the error
INVALID_ENUM is generated.

    The image pointed to by data and the imageSize parameter are interpreted
as though they were provided to CompressedTexImage1D, CompressedTexIm-
age2D, and CompressedTexImage3D. These commands do not provide for im-
age format conversion, so an INVALID_OPERATION error results if format does
not match the internal format of the texture image being modified. If the image-
Size parameter is not consistent with the format, dimensions, and contents of the
compressed image (too little or too much data), an INVALID_VALUE error results.
    As with CompressedTexImage calls, compressed internal formats may have
additional restrictions on the use of the compressed image specification calls or
parameters. Any such restrictions will be documented in the specification defin-
ing the compressed internal format; violating these restrictions will result in an
INVALID_OPERATION error.
    Any restrictions imposed by specific compressed internal formats will be in-
variant, meaning that if the GL accepts and stores a texture image in compressed
form, providing the same image to CompressedTexSubImage1D, Compressed-
TexSubImage2D, CompressedTexSubImage3D will not result in an INVALID_-
OPERATION error if the following restrictions are satisfied:

   • data points to a compressed texture image returned by GetCompressedTex-
     Image (section 6.1.4).

   • target, level, and format match the target, level and format parameters pro-
     vided to the GetCompressedTexImage call returning data.

   • width, height, depth, format, and imageSize match the values of TEXTURE_-
     WIDTH, TEXTURE_HEIGHT, TEXTURE_DEPTH, TEXTURE_INTERNAL_-
     FORMAT, and TEXTURE_COMPRESSED_IMAGE_SIZE for image level level
     in effect at the time of the GetCompressedTexImage call returning data.

   • width, height, depth, and format match the values of TEXTURE_WIDTH,
     TEXTURE_HEIGHT, TEXTURE_DEPTH, and TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT
     currently in effect for image level level.

   • xoffset, yoffset, and zoffset are all zero.

    This guarantee applies not just to images returned by GetCompressedTexIm-
age, but also to any other properly encoded compressed texture image of the same
size.
    Calling CompressedTexSubImage3D, CompressedTexSubImage2D, or
CompressedTexSubImage1D will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error if
xoffset, yoffset, or zoffset are not equal to zero, or if width, height, and depth

do not match the values of TEXTURE_WIDTH, TEXTURE_HEIGHT, or TEXTURE_-
DEPTH, respectively. The contents of any texel outside the region modified by the
call are undefined. These restrictions may be relaxed for specific compressed in-
ternal formats whose images are easily modified.
    If internalformat is one of the specific RGTC formats described in table 3.14,
the texture is stored using one of the RGTC compressed texture image encod-
ings (see appendix C.1). If internalformat is an RGTC format, CompressedTex-
SubImage1D will generate an INVALID_ENUM error; CompressedTexSubIm-
age2D will generate an INVALID_OPERATION error if border is non-zero; and
CompressedTexSubImage3D will generate an INVALID_OPERATION error if
border is non-zero or target is not TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY. Since RGTC images are
easily edited along 4×4 texel boundaries, the limitations on subimage location and
size are relaxed for CompressedTexSubImage2D and CompressedTexSubIm-
age3D. These commands will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error if one of
the following conditions occurs:

   • width is not a multiple of four, and width + xoffset is not equal to the value
     of TEXTURE_WIDTH.
   • height is not a multiple of four, and height + yoffset is not equal to the value
     of TEXTURE_HEIGHT.
   • xoffset or yoffset is not a multiple of four.

   The contents of any 4 × 4 block of texels of an RGTC compressed texture
image that does not intersect the area being modified are preserved during valid
TexSubImage* and CopyTexSubImage* calls.

3.8.6    Multisample Textures
In addition to the texture types described in previous sections, two additional types
of textures are supported. A multisample texture is similar to a two-dimensional
or two-dimensional array texture, except it contains multiple samples per texel.
Multisample textures do not have multiple image levels.
    The commands

        void TexImage2DMultisample( enum target, sizei samples,
           int internalformat, sizei width, sizei height,
           boolean fixedsamplelocations );
        void TexImage3DMultisample( enum target, sizei samples,
           int internalformat, sizei width, sizei height,
           sizei depth, boolean fixedsamplelocations );

establish the data storage, format, dimensions, and number of samples of a
multisample texture’s image. For TexImage2DMultisample, target must be
TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE or PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE and for
TexImage3DMultisample target must be TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY
or PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY. width and height are the dimen-
sions in texels of the texture.
    internalformat must be color-renderable, depth-renderable, or stencil- render-
able (as defined in section 4.4.4). The error INVALID_OPERATION may be gener-
ated if any of the following are true:

    • internalformat is a depth/stencil-renderable format and samples is greater
      than the value of MAX_DEPTH_TEXTURE_SAMPLES

    • internalformat is a color-renderable format and samples is greater than the
      value of MAX_COLOR_TEXTURE_SAMPLES

    • internalformat is a signed or unsigned integer format and samples is greater
      than the value of MAX_INTEGER_SAMPLES.

    If fixedsamplelocations is TRUE, the image will use identical sample locations
and the same number of samples for all texels in the image, and the sample loca-
tions will not depend on the internalformat or size of the image. If either width or
height is greater than MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, or if samples is greater than MAX_-
SAMPLES, then the error INVALID_VALUE is generated. If the GL is unable to
create a texture level of the requested size, the error OUT_OF_MEMORY is gener-
ated.
    When a multisample texture is accessed in a shader, the access takes one vector
of integers describing which texel to fetch and an integer corresponding to the
sample numbers described in section 3.3.1 describing which sample within the
texel to fetch. No standard sampling instructions are allowed on the multisample
texture targets.

3.8.7   Buffer Textures
In addition to one-, two-, and three-dimensional, one- and two-dimensional array,
and cube map textures described in previous sections, one additional type of texture
is supported. A buffer texture is similar to a one-dimensional texture. However,
unlike other texture types, the texel array is not stored as part of the texture. Instead,
a buffer object is attached to a buffer texture and the texel array is taken from that
buffer object’s data store. When the contents of a buffer object’s data store are
modified, those changes are reflected in the contents of any buffer texture to which

the buffer object is attached. Buffer textures do not have multiple image levels;
only a single data store is available.
    The command

      void TexBuffer( enum target, enum internalformat, uint
         buffer );

attaches the storage for the buffer object named buffer to the active buffer texture,
and specifies an internal format for the texel array found in the attached buffer
object. If buffer is zero, any buffer object attached to the buffer texture is detached,
and no new buffer object is attached. If buffer is non-zero, but is not the name
of an existing buffer object, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated. target
must be TEXTURE_BUFFER. internalformat specifies the storage format, and must
be one of the sized internal formats found in table 3.15.
     When a buffer object is attached to a buffer texture, the buffer object’s data store
is taken as the texture’s texel array. The number of texels in the buffer texture’s
texel array is given by

                                buf f er size
                                                        .
                        components × sizeof (base type)
     where buffer size is the size of the buffer object, in basic machine units and
components and base type are the element count and base data type for elements,
as specified in table 3.15. The number of texels in the texel array is then clamped
to the implementation-dependent limit MAX_TEXTURE_BUFFER_SIZE. When a
buffer texture is accessed in a shader, the results of a texel fetch are undefined
if the specified texel coordinate is negative, or greater than or equal to the clamped
number of texels in the texel array.
     When a buffer texture is accessed in a shader, an integer is provided to indicate
the texel coordinate being accessed. If no buffer object is bound to the buffer tex-
ture, the results of the texel access are undefined. Otherwise, the attached buffer
object’s data store is interpreted as an array of elements of the GL data type cor-
responding to internalformat. Each texel consists of one to four elements that are
mapped to texture components (R, G, B, and A). Element m of the texel numbered
n is taken from element n × components + m of the attached buffer object’s data
store. Elements and texels are both numbered starting with zero. For texture for-
mats with signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point components, the extracted
values are converted to floating-point using equations 2.1 or 2.3, respectively. The
components of the texture are then converted to an (R,G,B,A) vector according to
table 3.15, and returned to the shader as a four-component result vector with com-
ponents of the appropriate data type for the texture’s internal format. The base data

     In addition to attaching buffer objects to textures, buffer objects can be bound
to the buffer object target named TEXTURE_BUFFER, in order to specify, modify, or
read the buffer object’s data store. The buffer object bound to TEXTURE_BUFFER
has no effect on rendering. A buffer object is bound to TEXTURE_BUFFER by call-
ing BindBuffer with target set to TEXTURE_BUFFER, as described in section 2.9.

3.8.8    Texture Parameters
Various parameters control how the texel array is treated when specified or
changed, and when applied to a fragment. Each parameter is set by calling

        void TexParameter{if}( enum target, enum pname, T param );
        void TexParameter{if}v( enum target, enum pname, const
           T *params );
        void TexParameterI{i ui}v( enum target, enum pname, const
           T *params );

target is the target, either TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_3D, TEXTURE_-
1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY. TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP. params is a symbolic constant indicating the parameter to be set; the possible
constants and corresponding parameters are summarized in table 3.16. In the first
form of the command, param is a value to which to set a single-valued parameter;
in the remaining forms, params is an array of parameters whose type depends on
the parameter being set.
     If the values for TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are specified with TexParame-
terIiv or TexParameterIuiv, the values are unmodified and stored with an inter-
nal data type of integer. If specified with TexParameteriv, they are converted to
floating-point using equation 2.2. Otherwise the values are unmodified and stored
as floating-point.
     If pname is TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBA, params is an array of four
enums which respectively set the TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G,
TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, and TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A parameters simultaneously.
     The error INVALID_ENUM is generated if the type of the parameter specified
by pname is enum, and the value(s) specified by param or params are not among
the legal values shown in table 3.16.

    In the remainder of section 3.8, denote by lodmin , lodmax , levelbase , and
levelmax the values of the texture parameters TEXTURE_MIN_LOD, TEXTURE_-
MAX_LOD, TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL, and TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL respectively.
    Texture parameters for a cube map texture apply to the cube map as a whole;
the six distinct two-dimensional texture images use the texture parameters of the
cube map itself.
    When target is TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, certain texture parameter values may
not be specified. In this case, the error INVALID_ENUM is generated if the
TEXTURE_WRAP_S, TEXTURE_WRAP_T, or TEXTURE_WRAP_R parameter is set
to REPEAT or MIRRORED_REPEAT. The error INVALID_ENUM is generated if
TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is set to a value other than NEAREST or LINEAR (no
mipmap filtering is permitted). The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if
TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL is set to any value other than zero.

3.8.9    Depth Component Textures
Depth textures and the depth components of depth/stencil textures can be treated
as RED textures during texture filtering and application (see section 3.8.16). The
initial state for depth and depth/stencil textures treats them as RED textures.

3.8.10    Cube Map Texture Selection
When cube map texturing is enabled, the s t r texture coordinates are treated
as a direction vector rx ry rz emanating from the center of a cube (the q
coordinate can be ignored, since it merely scales the vector without affecting the
direction.) At texture application time, the interpolated per-fragment direction vec-
tor selects one of the cube map face’s two-dimensional images based on the largest
magnitude coordinate direction (the major axis direction). If two or more coor-
dinates have the identical magnitude, the implementation may define the rule to
disambiguate this situation. The rule must be deterministic and depend only on
  rx ry rz . The target column in table 3.17 explains how the major axis direc-
tion maps to the two-dimensional image of a particular cube map target.

    Using the sc , tc , and ma determined by the major axis direction as specified in
table 3.17, an updated s t is calculated as follows:

Seamless Cube Map Filtering
Seamless cube map filtering is enabled or disabled by calling Enable or Disable,
respectively, with the symbolic constant TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_SEAMLESS.
    When seamless cube map filtering is disabled, the new s t is used to find a
texture value in the determined face’s two-dimensional image using the rules given
in sections 3.8.11 through 3.8.12.
    When seamless cube map filtering is enabled, the rules for texel selection in
sections 3.8.11 through 3.8.12 are modified so that texture wrap modes are ignored.
Instead,

   • If NEAREST filtering is done within a miplevel, always apply wrap mode
     CLAMP_TO_EDGE.

   • If LINEAR filtering is done within a miplevel, always apply wrap mode
     CLAMP_TO_BORDER. Then,

         – If a texture sample location would lie in the texture border in either u
           or v, instead select the corresponding texel from the appropriate neigh-
           boring face.

         – If a texture sample location would lie in the texture border in both u
           and v (in one of the corners of the cube), there is no unique neighbor-
           ing face from which to extract one texel. The recommended method to
           generate this texel is to average the values of the three available sam-
           ples. However, implementations are free to construct this fourth texel
           in another way, so long as, when the three available samples have the
           same value, this texel also has that value.

   The required state is one bit indicating whether seamless cube map filtering is
enabled or disabled. Initially, it is disabled.

3.8.11   Texture Minification
Applying a texture to a primitive implies a mapping from texture image space to
framebuffer image space. In general, this mapping involves a reconstruction of
the sampled texture image, followed by a homogeneous warping implied by the
mapping to framebuffer space, then a filtering, followed finally by a resampling
of the filtered, warped, reconstructed image before applying it to a fragment. In
the GL this mapping is approximated by one of two simple filtering schemes. One
of these schemes is selected based on whether the mapping from texture space to
framebuffer space is deemed to magnify or minify the texture image.

Scale Factor and Level of Detail
The choice is governed by a scale factor ρ(x, y) and the level-of-detail parameter
λ(x, y), defined as

                            λbase (x, y) = log2 [ρ(x, y)]                    (3.17)


            λ (x, y) = λbase (x, y) + clamp(biastexobj + biasshader )        (3.18)

biastexobj is the value of TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS for the bound texture object (as
described in section 3.8.8). biasshader is the value of the optional bias parameter
in the texture lookup functions available to fragment shaders. If the texture access

is performed in a fragment shader without a provided bias, or outside a fragment
shader, then biasshader is zero. The sum of these values is clamped to the range
[−biasmax , biasmax ] where biasmax is the value of the implementation defined
constant MAX_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS.
     If λ(x, y) is less than or equal to the constant c (see section 3.8.12) the texture
is said to be magnified; if it is greater, the texture is minified. Sampling of minified
textures is described in the remainder of this section, while sampling of magnified
textures is described in section 3.8.12.
     The initial values of lodmin and lodmax are chosen so as to never clamp the
normal range of λ. They may be respecified for a specific texture by calling Tex-
Parameter[if] with pname set to TEXTURE_MIN_LOD or TEXTURE_MAX_LOD re-
spectively.
     Let s(x, y) be the function that associates an s texture coordinate with each set
of window coordinates (x, y) that lie within a primitive; define t(x, y) and r(x, y)
analogously. Let

               w(x, y) = dt × r(x, y) + δw

where wt , ht , and dt are as defined by equation 3.16 with ws , hs , and ds equal to
the width, height, and depth of the image array whose level is levelbase . For a one-
dimensional or one-dimensional array texture, define v(x, y) = 0 and w(x, y) = 0;
for a two-dimensional, two-dimensional array, rectangular, or cube map texture,
define w(x, y) = 0.
    (δu , δv , δw ) are the texel offsets specified in the OpenGL Shading Language
texture lookup functions that support offsets. If the texture function used does
not support offsets, all three shader offsets are taken to be zero. If any of the
offset values are outside the range of the implementation-defined values MIN_-
PROGRAM_TEXEL_OFFSET and MAX_PROGRAM_TEXEL_OFFSET, results of the
texture lookup are undefined.

Coordinate Wrapping and Texel Selection
After generating u(x, y), v(x, y), and w(x, y), they may be clamped and wrapped
before sampling the texture, depending on the corresponding texture wrap modes.
    Let u (x, y) = u(x, y), v (x, y) = v(x, y), and w (x, y) = w(x, y).
    The value assigned to TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is used to determine how the
texture value for a fragment is selected.
    When the value of TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is NEAREST, the texel in the image
array of level levelbase that is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to (u , v , w ) is
obtained. Let (i, j, k) be integers such that


                                 i = wrap( u (x, y) )
                                 j = wrap( v (x, y) )
                                 k = wrap( w (x, y) )

and the value returned by wrap() is defined in table 3.18. For a three-dimensional
texture, the texel at location (i, j, k) becomes the texture value. For two-
dimensional, two-dimensional array, rectangular, or cube map textures, k is irrele-
vant, and the texel at location (i, j) becomes the texture value. For one-dimensional
texture or one-dimensional array textures, j and k are irrelevant, and the texel at
location i becomes the texture value.
    For one- and two-dimensional array textures, the texel is obtained from image
layer l, where


            clamp( t + 0.5 , 0, ht − 1),      for one-dimensional array textures
     l=
            clamp( r + 0.5 , 0, dt − 1),      for two-dimensional array textures

   If the selected (i, j, k), (i, j), or i location refers to a border texel that satisfies
any of the conditions


                       i < −bs                         i ≥ wt + bs
                      j < −bs                         j ≥ ht + bs
                      k < −bs                         k ≥ dt + bs

then the border values defined by TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are used in place
of the non-existent texel. If the texture contains color components, the values of
TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are interpreted as an RGBA color to match the texture’s
internal format in a manner consistent with table 3.11. The internal data type of the

border values must be consistent with the type returned by the texture as described
in section 3.8, or the result is undefined. Border values are clamped before they are
used, according to the format in which texture components are stored. For signed
and unsigned normalized fixed-point formats, border values are clamped to [−1, 1]
and [0, 1], respectively. For floating-point and integer formats, border values are
clamped to the representable range of the format. If the texture contains depth
components, the first component of TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR is interpreted as a
depth value.
    When the value of TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is LINEAR, a 2 × 2 × 2 cube of
texels in the image array of level levelbase is selected. Let


                            i0 = wrap( u − 0.5 )
                            j0 = wrap( v − 0.5 )
                           k0 = wrap( w − 0.5 )

where τijk is the texel at location (i, j, k) in the three-dimensional texture image.
    For a two-dimensional, two-dimensional array, rectangular, or cube map tex-
ture,


                     τ =(1 − α)(1 − β)τi0 j0 + α(1 − β)τi1 j0
                          + (1 − α)βτi0 j1 + αβτi1 j1

where τij is the texel at location (i, j) in the two-dimensional texture image. For
two-dimensional array textures, all texels are obtained from layer l, where

                          l = clamp( r + 0.5 , 0, dt − 1).
    And for a one-dimensional or one-dimensional array texture,

                               τ = (1 − α)τi0 + ατi1

   where τi is the texel at location i in the one-dimensional texture. For one-
dimensional array textures, both texels are obtained from layer l, where

                          l = clamp( t + 0.5 , 0, ht − 1).
    For any texel in the equation above that refers to a border texel outside the
defined range of the image, the texel value is taken from the texture border color as
with NEAREST filtering.

Rendering Feedback Loops
If all of the following conditions are satisfied, then the value of the selected τijk ,
τij , or τi in the above equations is undefined instead of referring to the value of the
texel at location (i, j, k), (i, j), or (i) respectively. This situation is discussed in
more detail in the description of feedback loops in section 4.4.3.

Mipmapping
TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER values NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST, NEAREST_-
MIPMAP_LINEAR, LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST, and LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
each require the use of a mipmap. Rectangular textures do not support mipmapping
(it is an error to specify a minification filter that requires mipmapping). A mipmap
is an ordered set of arrays representing the same image; each array has a resolution
lower than the previous one. If the image array of level levelbase has dimensions
wt × ht × dt , then there are log2 (maxsize) + 1 levels in the mipmap. where

    Each array in a mipmap is defined using TexImage3D, TexImage2D, Copy-
TexImage2D, TexImage1D, or CopyTexImage1D; the array being set is indicated
with the level-of-detail argument level. Level-of-detail numbers proceed from
levelbase for the original texel array through p = log2 (maxsize) + levelbase
with each unit increase indicating an array of half the dimensions of the previous
one (rounded down to the next integer if fractional) as already described. All ar-
rays from levelbase through q = min{p, levelmax } must be defined, as discussed
in section 3.8.14.
    The values of levelbase and levelmax may be respecified for a specific tex-
ture by calling TexParameter[if] with pname set to TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL or
TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL respectively.
    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if either value is negative.
    The mipmap is used in conjunction with the level of detail to approximate the
application of an appropriately filtered texture to a fragment. Let c be the value
of λ at which the transition from minification to magnification occurs (since this
discussion pertains to minification, we are concerned only with values of λ where
λ > c).

     The rules for NEAREST or LINEAR filtering are then applied to the selected
array. Specifically, the coordinate (u, v, w) is computed as in equation 3.20, with
ws , hs , and ds equal to the width, height, and depth of the image array whose level
is d.
     For mipmap filters NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR and LINEAR_MIPMAP_-

                            d1 + 1, otherwise

     The rules for NEAREST or LINEAR filtering are then applied to each of the
selected arrays, yielding two corresponding texture values τ1 and τ2 . Specifically,
for level d1 , the coordinate (u, v, w) is computed as in equation 3.20, with ws , hs ,
and ds equal to the width, height, and depth of the image array whose level is d1 .
For level d2 the coordinate (u , v , w ) is computed as in equation 3.20, with ws ,
hs , and ds equal to the width, height, and depth of the image array whose level is
d2 .
     The final texture value is then found as

                          τ = [1 − frac(λ)]τ1 + frac(λ)τ2 .

Manual Mipmap Generation
Mipmaps can be generated manually with the command

      void GenerateMipmap( enum target );

where target is one of TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_3D, TEXTURE_-
1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, or TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP. Mipmap generation
affects the texture image attached to target. For cube map textures, an INVALID_-
OPERATION error is generated if the texture bound to target is not cube complete,
as defined in section 3.8.14.
     Mipmap generation replaces texel array levels levelbase + 1 through q with
arrays derived from the levelbase array, regardless of their previous contents. All
other mipmap arrays, including the levelbase array, are left unchanged by this com-
putation.
     The internal formats of the derived mipmap arrays all match those of the
levelbase array, and the dimensions of the derived arrays follow the requirements
described in section 3.8.14.
     The contents of the derived arrays are computed by repeated, filtered reduction
of the levelbase array. For one- and two-dimensional array textures, each layer is
filtered independently. No particular filter algorithm is required, though a box filter
is recommended as the default filter.

3.8.12   Texture Magnification
When λ indicates magnification, the value assigned to TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER
determines how the texture value is obtained. There are two possible values
for TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER: NEAREST and LINEAR. NEAREST behaves exactly as
NEAREST for TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER and LINEAR behaves exactly as LINEAR for
TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER as described in section 3.8.11, including the texture coor-
dinate wrap modes specified in table 3.18. The level-of-detail levelbase texel array
is always used for magnification.
     Implementations may either unconditionally assume c = 0 for the minifica-
tion vs. magnification switch-over point, or may choose to make c depend on the
combination of minification and magnification modes as follows: if the magnifica-
tion filter is given by LINEAR and the minification filter is given by NEAREST_-
MIPMAP_NEAREST or NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR, then c = 0.5. This is done to
ensure that a minified texture does not appear “sharper” than a magnified texture.
Otherwise c = 0.

3.8.13   Combined Depth/Stencil Textures
If the texture image has a base internal format of DEPTH_STENCIL, then the stencil
index texture component is ignored. The texture value τ does not include a stencil
index component, but includes only the depth component.

3.8.14   Texture Completeness
A texture is said to be complete if all the image arrays and texture parameters
required to utilize the texture for texture application are consistently defined. The
definition of completeness varies depending on texture dimensionality and type.
    For one-, two-, and three-dimensional and one-and two-dimensional array tex-
tures, a texture is mipmap complete if all of the following conditions hold true:

   • The set of mipmap arrays levelbase through q (where q is defined in the
     Mipmapping discussion of section 3.8.11) were each specified with the
     same internal format.

   • The dimensions of the arrays follow the sequence described in the Mipmap-
     ping discussion of section 3.8.11.

   • levelbase ≤ levelmax

Array levels k where k < levelbase or k > q are insignificant to the definition of
completeness.

   A cube map texture is mipmap complete if each of the six texture images,
considered individually, is mipmap complete. Additionally, a cube map texture is
cube complete if the following conditions all hold true:

   • The levelbase arrays of each of the six texture images making up the cube
     map have identical, positive, and square dimensions.

   • The levelbase arrays were each specified with the same internal format.

    Using the preceding definitions, a texture is complete unless any of the follow-
ing conditions hold true:

   • Any dimension of the levelbase array is not positive. For a rectangular or
     multisample texture, levelbase is always zero.

   • The texture is a cube map texture, and is not cube complete.

   • The minification filter requires a mipmap (is neither NEAREST nor LINEAR),
     and the texture is not mipmap complete.

   • The internal format of the texture arrays is integer (see table 3.12), and
     either the magnification filter is not NEAREST, or the minification filter is
     neither NEAREST nor NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST.

Effects of Sampler Objects on Texture Completeness
If a sampler object and a texture object are simultaneously bound to the same tex-
ture unit, then the sampling state for that unit is taken from the sampler object (see
section 3.8.2). This can have an effect on the effective completeness of the texture.
In particular, if the texture is not mipmap complete and the sampler object speci-
fies a TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER requiring mipmaps, the texture will be considered
incomplete for the purposes of that texture unit. However, if the sampler object
does not require mipmaps, the texture object will be considered complete. This
means that a texture can be considered both complete and incomplete simultane-
ously if it is bound to two or more texture units along with sampler objects with
different states.

Effects of Completeness on Texture Application
Texture lookup and texture fetch operations performed in vertex, geometry, and
fragment shaders are affected by completeness of the texture being sampled as
described in sections 2.11.4 and 3.9.2.

Effects of Completeness on Texture Image Specification
An implementation may allow a texture image array of level 1 or greater to be
created only if a mipmap complete set of image arrays consistent with the requested
array can be supported with levelbase = 0 and levelmax = 1000.

3.8.15    Texture State and Proxy State
The state necessary for texture can be divided into two categories. First, there are
the multiple sets of texel arrays (a single array for the rectangular texture target; one
set of mipmap arrays each for the one-, two-, and three-dimensional and one- and
two-dimensional array texture targets; and six sets of mipmap arrays for the cube
map texture targets) and their number. Each array has associated with it a width,
height (two- and three-dimensional, rectangular, one-dimensional array, and cube
map only), and depth (three-dimensional and two-dimensional array only), an
integer describing the internal format of the image, integer values describing the
resolutions of each of the red, green, blue, alpha, depth, and stencil components
of the image, integer values describing the type (unsigned normalized, integer,
floating-point, etc.) of each of the components, a boolean describing whether the
image is compressed or not, and an integer size of a compressed image. Each
initial texel array is null (zero width, height, and depth, internal format RGBA,
component sizes set to zero and component types set to NONE, the compressed flag
set to FALSE, and a zero compressed size). Multisample textures contain an integer
identifying the number of samples in each texel, and a boolean indicating whether
identical sample locations and the same number of samples will be used for all
texels in the image. The buffer texture target has associated an integer containing
the name of the buffer object that provided the data store for the texture, initially
zero, and an integer identifying the internal format of the texture, initially R8.
     Next, there are the four sets of texture properties, corresponding to the one-,
two-, three-dimensional, and cube map texture targets. Each set consists of the
selected minification and magnification filters, the wrap modes for s, t (two-
and three-dimensional and cube map only), and r (three-dimensional only), the
TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR, two floating-point numbers describing the minimum
and maximum level of detail, two integers describing the base and maximum
mipmap array, a boolean flag indicating whether the texture is resident, and
three integers describing the depth texture mode, compare mode, and compare
function.      In the initial state, the value assigned to TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER
is NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR (except for rectangular textures, where the initial
value is LINEAR), and the value for TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is LINEAR. s, t, and r
wrap modes are all set to REPEAT (except for rectangular textures, where the initial

value is CLAMP_TO_EDGE). The values of TEXTURE_MIN_LOD and TEXTURE_-
MAX_LOD are -1000 and 1000 respectively. The values of TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL
and TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL are 0 and 1000 respectively. The value of TEXTURE_-
BORDER_COLOR is (0,0,0,0).    The values of TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE, and
TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC are NONE, and LEQUAL respectively.
     In addition to image arrays for the non-proxy texture targets described above,
partially instantiated image arrays are maintained for one-, two-, and three-
dimensional, rectangular, and one- and two-dimensional array textures. Addition-
ally, a single proxy image array is maintained for the cube map texture. Each proxy
image array includes width, height, depth, and internal format state values, as well
as state for the red, green, blue, alpha, depth, and stencil component resolutions
and types. Proxy arrays do not include image data nor texture parameters. When
TexImage3D is executed with target specified as PROXY_TEXTURE_3D, the three-
dimensional proxy state values of the specified level-of-detail are recomputed and
updated. If the image array would not be supported by TexImage3D called with
target set to TEXTURE_3D, no error is generated, but the proxy width, height, depth,
and component resolutions are set to zero, and the component types are set to NONE.
If the image array would be supported by such a call to TexImage3D, the proxy
state values are set exactly as though the actual image array were being specified.
No pixel data are transferred or processed in either case.
     Proxy arrays for one- and two-dimensional textures and one- and two-
dimensional array textures are operated on in the same way when TexImage1D is
executed with target specified as PROXY_TEXTURE_1D, TexImage2D is executed
with target specified as PROXY_TEXTURE_2D, PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, or
PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or TexImage3D is executed with target specified
as PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY.
     Proxy arrays for two-dimensional multisample and two-dimensional multisam-
ple array textures are operated on in the same way when TexImage2DMultisample
is called with target specified as PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE, or Tex-
Image3DMultisample is called with target specified as PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_-
MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY.
     The cube map proxy arrays are operated on in the same manner when TexIm-
age2D is executed with the target field specified as PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP,
with the addition that determining that a given cube map texture is supported with
PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP indicates that all six of the cube map 2D images
are supported. Likewise, if the specified PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP is not sup-
ported, none of the six cube map 2D images are supported.
     There is no image or non-level-related state associated with proxy textures.
Therefore they may not be used as textures, and calling BindTexture, GetTex-
Image, GetTexParameteriv, or GetTexParameterfv with a proxy texture target

generates an INVALID_ENUM error.

3.8.16   Texture Comparison Modes
Texture values can also be computed according to a specified comparison function.
Texture parameter TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE specifies the comparison operands,
and parameter TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC specifies the comparison function.

Depth Texture Comparison Mode
If the currently bound texture’s base internal format is DEPTH_COMPONENT or
DEPTH_STENCIL, then TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE and TEXTURE_COMPARE_-
FUNC control the output of the texture unit as described below. Otherwise, the
texture unit operates in the normal manner and texture comparison is bypassed.
    Let Dt be the depth texture value and Dref be the reference value, provided
by the shader’s texture lookup function.
    If the texture’s internal format indicates a fixed-point depth texture, then Dt
and Dref are clamped to the range [0, 1]; otherwise no clamping is performed.
Then the effective texture value is computed as follows:
    If the value of TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is NONE, then

                                      r = Dt
    If the value of TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE,
then r depends on the texture comparison function as shown in table 3.19.
    The resulting r is assigned to Rt .
    If the value of TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is not NEAREST, or the value of
TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is not NEAREST or NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST, then r
may be computed by comparing more than one depth texture value to the texture
reference value. The details of this are implementation-dependent, but r should
be a value in the range [0, 1] which is proportional to the number of comparison
passes or failures.

3.8.17   sRGB Texture Color Conversion
If the currently bound texture’s internal format is one of SRGB, SRGB8, SRGB_-
ALPHA, SRGB8_ALPHA8, COMPRESSED_SRGB, or COMPRESSED_SRGB_ALPHA,
the red, green, and blue components are converted from an sRGB color space to a
linear color space as part of filtering described in sections 3.8.11 and 3.8.12. Any
alpha component is left unchanged. Ideally, implementations should perform this
color conversion on each sample prior to filtering but implementations are allowed

to perform this conversion after filtering (though this post-filtering approach is in-
ferior to converting from sRGB prior to filtering).
      The conversion from an sRGB encoded component, cs , to a linear component,
cl , is as follows.
                                cs

3.8.18    Shared Exponent Texture Color Conversion
If the currently bound texture’s internal format is RGB9_E5, the red, green, blue,
and shared bits are converted to color components (prior to filtering) using shared
exponent decoding. The component reds , greens , blues , and expshared values (see
section 3.8.3) are treated as unsigned integers and are converted to red, green, and
blue as follows:

                           green = greens 2expshared −B
                             blue = blues 2expshared −B


3.9     Fragment Shaders
The sequence of operations that are applied to fragments that result from rasterizing
a point, line segment, or polygon are described using a fragment shader.
    A fragment shader is an array of strings containing source code for the opera-
tions that are meant to occur on each fragment that results from rasterization. The
language used for fragment shaders is described in the OpenGL Shading Language
Specification.
    Fragment shaders are created as described in section 2.11.1 using a type pa-
rameter of FRAGMENT_SHADER. They are attached to and used in program objects
as described in section 2.11.2.
    When the program object currently in use includes a fragment shader, its frag-
ment shader is considered active, and is used to process fragments. If the program
object has no fragment shader, or no program object is currently in use, the results
of fragment shader execution are undefined.

3.9.1   Shader Variables
Fragment shaders can access uniforms belonging to the current shader object. The
amount of storage available for fragment shader uniform variables in the default
uniform block is specified by the value of the implementation-dependent constant
MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS. The total amount of combined storage
available for fragment shader uniform variables in all uniform blocks (including the
default uniform block) is specified by the value of the implementation-dependent
constant MAX_COMBINED_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_COMPONENTS. These values rep-
resent the numbers of individual floating-point, integer, or boolean values that can
be held in uniform variable storage for a fragment shader. A uniform matrix will
consume no more than 4 × min(r, c) such values, where r and c are the number of
rows and columns in the matrix. A link error will be generated if an attempt is made
to utilize more than the space available for fragment shader uniform variables.
     Fragment shaders can read varying variables that correspond to the attributes
of the fragments produced by rasterization. The OpenGL Shading Language Spec-
ification defines a set of built-in varying variables that can be be accessed by a

fragment shader. These built-in varying variables include data associated with a
fragment such as the fragment’s position.
    Additionally, when a vertex shader is active, it may define one or more varying
variables (see section 2.11.6 and the OpenGL Shading Language Specification).
These values are, if not flat shaded, interpolated across the primitive being ren-
dered. The results of these interpolations are available when varying variables of
the same name are defined in the fragment shader.
    A fragment shader can also write to varying out variables. Values written to
these variables are used in the subsequent per-fragment operations. Varying out
variables can be used to write floating-point, integer or unsigned integer values des-
tined for buffers attached to a framebuffer object, or destined for color buffers at-
tached to the default framebuffer. The Shader Outputs subsection of section 3.9.2
describes how to direct these values to buffers.

3.9.2   Shader Execution
The executable version of the fragment shader is used to process incoming frag-
ment values that are the result of rasterization.

Texture Access
The Shader Only Texturing subsection of section 2.11.7 describes texture lookup
functionality accessible to a vertex shader. The texel fetch and texture size query
functionality described there also applies to fragment shaders.
    When a texture lookup is performed in a fragment shader, the GL computes
the filtered texture value τ in the manner described in sections 3.8.11 and 3.8.12,
and converts it to a texture base color Cb as shown in table 3.20, followed
by swizzling the components of Cb , controlled by the values of the texture pa-
rameters TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G, TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B,
and TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A. If the value of TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is denoted by
swizzler , swizzling computes the first component of Cs according to

    if (swizzler == RED)
       Cs [0] = Cb [0];
    else if (swizzler == GREEN)
       Cs [0] = Cb [1];
    else if (swizzler == BLUE)
       Cs [0] = Cb [2];
    else if (swizzler == ALPHA)
       Cs [0] = Ab ;

       Cs [0] = 0;
    else if (swizzler == ONE)
       Cs [0] = 1; // float or int depending on texture component type

     Swizzling of Cs [1], Cs [2], and As are similarly controlled by the values of
TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G, TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, and TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A, re-
spectively.
     The resulting four-component vector (Rs , Gs , Bs , As ) is returned to the frag-
ment shader. For the purposes of level-of-detail calculations, the derivatives du   du

dv dv dw         dw
dx , dy , dx and dy may be approximated by a differencing algorithm as detailed in
section 8.8 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification.
     Texture lookups involving textures with depth component data can either return
the depth data directly or return the results of a comparison with the Dref value (see
section 3.8.16) used to perform the lookup. The comparison operation is requested
in the shader by using any of the shadow sampler types (sampler1DShadow,
sampler2DShadow, or sampler2DRectShadow), and in the texture using the
TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE parameter. These requests must be consistent; the re-
sults of a texture lookup are undefined if:

    • The sampler used in a texture lookup function is not one of the shadow
      sampler types, the texture object’s internal format is DEPTH_COMPONENT
      or DEPTH_STENCIL, and the TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is not NONE.

    • The sampler used in a texture lookup function is one of the shadow sam-
      pler types, the texture object’s internal format is DEPTH_COMPONENT or
      DEPTH_STENCIL, and the TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE is NONE.

    • The sampler used in a texture lookup function is one of the shadow sampler
      types, and the texture object’s internal format is not DEPTH_COMPONENT or

      DEPTH_STENCIL.

    The stencil index texture internal component is ignored if the base internal
format is DEPTH_STENCIL.
    Using a sampler in a fragment shader will return (R, G, B, A) = (0, 0, 0, 1) if
the sampler’s associated texture is not complete, as defined in section 3.8.14.
    The number of separate texture units that can be accessed from within a
fragment shader during the rendering of a single primitive is specified by the
implementation-dependent constant MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS.

Shader Inputs
The OpenGL Shading Language Specification describes the values that are avail-
able as inputs to the fragment shader.
    The built-in variable gl_FragCoord holds the fragment coordinate
 xf yf zf wf for the fragment. Computing the fragment coordinate depends
on the fragment processing pixel-center and origin conventions (discussed below)
as follows:


                       xw − 21 , pixel-center convention is integer
               xf =
                       xw ,      otherwise
                       H − yw , origin convention is upper-left
                yf =
                       yw ,     otherwise
                                                                             (3.28)
                       yf − 12 , pixel-center convention is integer
                yf =
                       yf        otherwise
               zf = zw
                     1
               wf =
                    wc

where xw yw zw is the fragment’s window-space position, wc is the w compo-
nent of the fragment’s clip-space position, and H is the window’s height in pixels.
Note that zw already has a polygon offset added in, if enabled (see section 3.6.4).
zf must be precisely 0 or 1 in the case where zw is either 0 or 1, respectively. The
 1
w value is computed from the wc coordinate (see section 2.13).
    Unless otherwise specified by layout qualifiers in the fragment shader (see sec-
tion 4.3.8.1 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification), the fragment pro-
cessing pixel-center convention is half-integer and the fragment processing origin
convention is lower-left.

3.9. FRAGMENT SHADERS                                                            189


    The built-in variable gl_FrontFacing is set to TRUE if the fragment is gen-
erated from a front-facing primitive, and FALSE otherwise. For fragments gener-
ated from triangle primitives (including ones resulting from primitives rendered
as points or lines), the determination is made by examining the sign of the area
computed by equation 3.8 of section 3.6.1 (including the possible reversal of this
sign controlled by FrontFace). If the sign is positive, fragments generated by the
primitive are front-facing; otherwise, they are back-facing. All other fragments are
considered front-facing.
    If a geometry shader is active, the built-in variable gl_PrimitiveID con-
tains the ID value emitted by the geometry shader for the provoking vertex. If no
geometry shader is active, gl_PrimitiveID contains the number of primitives
processed by the rasterizer since the last drawing command was called. The first
primitive generated by a drawing command is numbered zero, and the primitive ID
counter is incremented after every individual point, line, or polygon primitive is
processed. For polygons drawn in point or line mode, the primitive ID counter is
incremented only once, even though multiple points or lines may be drawn.
    Restarting a primitive using the primitive restart index (see section 2.8) has no
effect on the primitive ID counter.
    gl_PrimitiveID is only defined under the same conditions that gl_-
VertexID is defined, as described under “Shader Inputs” in section 2.11.4.
    Similarly to the limit on geometry shader output components (see sec-
tion 2.12.4), there is a limit on the number of components of built-in and user-
defined input varying variables that can be read by the fragment shader, given
by the value of the implementation-dependent constant MAX_FRAGMENT_INPUT_-
COMPONENTS.
    When a program is linked, all components of any varying and special variable
read by a fragment shader will count against this limit. A program whose fragment
shader exceeds this limit may fail to link, unless device-dependent optimizations
are able to make the program fit within available hardware resources.
    Component counting rules for different variable types and variable declarations
are the same as for MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS. (see section 2.11.6).

Shader Outputs
The OpenGL Shading Language Specification describes the values that may be
output by a fragment shader. These outputs are split into two categories, user-
defined varying out variables and the built-in variables gl_FragColor, gl_-
FragData[n], and gl_FragDepth.             For fixed-point depth buffers, the final
fragment depth written by a fragment shader is first clamped to [0, 1] and then
converted to fixed-point as if it were a window z value (see section 2.13.1). For

floating-point depth buffers, conversion is not performed but clamping is. Note that
the depth range computation is not applied here, only the conversion to fixed-point.
     Color values written by a fragment shader may be floating-point, signed inte-
ger, or unsigned integer. If the color buffer has an signed or unsigned normalized
fixed-point format, color values are assumed to be floating-point and are converted
to fixed-point as described in equations 2.6 or 2.4, respectively; otherwise no type
conversion is applied. If the values written by the fragment shader do not match
the format(s) of the corresponding color buffer(s), the result is undefined.
     Writing to gl_FragColor specifies the fragment color (color number zero)
that will be used by subsequent stages of the pipeline. Writing to gl_-
FragData[n] specifies the value of fragment color number n. Any colors, or
color components, associated with a fragment that are not written by the frag-
ment shader are undefined. A fragment shader may not statically assign values to
more than one of gl_FragColor, gl_FragData, and any user-defined varying
out variable. In this case, a compile or link error will result. A shader statically
assigns a value to a variable if, after pre-processing, it contains a statement that
would write to the variable, whether or not run-time flow of control will cause that
statement to be executed.
     Writing to gl_FragDepth specifies the depth value for the fragment being
processed. If the active fragment shader does not statically assign a value to gl_-
FragDepth, then the depth value generated during rasterization is used by sub-
sequent stages of the pipeline. Otherwise, the value assigned to gl_FragDepth
is used, and is undefined for any fragments where statements assigning a value to
gl_FragDepth are not executed. Thus, if a shader statically assigns a value to
gl_FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.
     The binding of a user-defined varying out variable to a fragment color number
can be specified explicitly. The command
      void BindFragDataLocationIndexed( uint program,
         uint colorNumber, uint index, const char * name );
specifies that the varying out variable name in program should be bound to frag-
ment color colorNumber when the program is next linked. index may be zero or
one to specify that the color be used as either the first or second color input to the
blend equation, respectively, as described in section 4.1.7.
    If name was bound previously, its assigned binding is replaced with color-
Number. name must be a null-terminated string. The error INVALID_VALUE is
generated if index is greater than one, if colorNumber is greater than or equal to
the value of MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS and index is zero, or if colorNumber is greater
than or equal to the value of MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS and index is
greater than or equal to one. The command

      void BindFragDataLocation( uint program,
         uint colorNumber, const char * name );

is equivalent to calling

    BindFragDataLocationIndexed(program, colorN umber, 0, name);

     BindFragDataLocation has no effect until the program is linked. In particular,
it doesn’t modify the bindings of varying out variables in a program that has already
been linked. The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if name starts with the
reserved gl_ prefix.
     When a program is linked, any varying out variables without a binding speci-
fied either through BindFragDataLocationIndexed or BindFragDataLocation,
or explicitly set within the shader text will automatically be bound to fragment
colors and indices by the GL. All such assignments will use color indices of
zero. Such bindings can be queried using the commands GetFragDataLoca-
tion and GetFragDataIndex. If a varying out variable has a binding explicitly
set within the shader text and a different binding assigned by BindFragDataLoca-
tionIndexed or BindFragDataLocation, the assignment in the shader text is used.
Output binding assignments will cause LinkProgram to fail:

   • if the number of active outputs is greater than the value of MAX_DRAW_-
     BUFFERS;

   • if the program has an active output assigned to a location greater than or
     equal to the value of MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS and has an active
     output assigned an index greater than or equal to one;

   • if more than one varying out variable is bound to the same number and index;
     or

   • if the explicit binding assigments do not leave enough space for the linker
     to automatically assign a location for a varying out array, which requires
     multiple contiguous locations.

    BindFragDataLocationIndexed may be issued before any shader objects are
attached to a program object. Hence it is allowed to bind any name (except a name
starting with gl_) to a color number and index, including a name that is never used
as a varying out variable in any fragment shader object. Assigned bindings for
variables that do not exist are ignored.
    After a program object has been linked successfully, the bindings of varying
out variable names to color numbers can be queried. The command

       int GetFragDataLocation( uint program, const
          char *name );

returns the number of the fragment color to which the varying out variable name
was bound when the program object program was last linked. name must be
a null-terminated string. If program has not been successfully linked, the error
INVALID_OPERATION is generated. If name is not a varying out variable, or if an
error occurs, -1 will be returned.
    The command

       int GetFragDataIndex( uint program, const char *
          name );

returns the index of the fragment color to which the variable name was bound when
the program object program was last linked. If program has not been successfully
linked, the error INVALID_OPERATION is generated. If name is not a varying out
variable, or if an error occurs, -1 will be returned.


3.10     Antialiasing Application
If antialiasing is enabled for the primitive from which a rasterized fragment was
produced, then the computed coverage value is applied to the fragment. The value
is multiplied by the fragment’s alpha (A) value to yield a final alpha value. The
coverage value is applied separately to each fragment color, and only applied if the
corresponding color buffer in the framebuffer has a fixed- or floating-point format.


3.11     Multisample Point Fade
Finally, if multisampling is enabled and the rasterized fragment results from a point
primitive, then the computed fade factor from equation 3.2 is applied to the frag-
ment. The fade factor is multiplied by the fragment’s alpha value to yield a final
alpha value. The fade factor is applied separately to each fragment color, and
only applied if the corresponding color buffer in the framebuffer has a fixed- or
floating-point format.

Chapter 4

Per-Fragment Operations and the
Framebuffer

The framebuffer, whether it is the default framebuffer or a framebuffer object (see
section 2.1), consists of a set of pixels arranged as a two-dimensional array. For
purposes of this discussion, each pixel in the framebuffer is simply a set of some
number of bits. The number of bits per pixel may vary depending on the GL im-
plementation, the type of framebuffer selected, and parameters specified when the
framebuffer was created. Creation and management of the default framebuffer is
outside the scope of this specification, while creation and management of frame-
buffer objects is described in detail in section 4.4.
    Corresponding bits from each pixel in the framebuffer are grouped together
into a bitplane; each bitplane contains a single bit from each pixel. These bitplanes
are grouped into several logical buffers. These are the color, depth, and stencil
buffers. The color buffer actually consists of a number of buffers, and these color
buffers serve related but slightly different purposes depending on whether the GL
is bound to the default framebuffer or a framebuffer object.
    For the default framebuffer, the color buffers are the front left buffer, the front
right buffer, the back left buffer, and the back right buffer. Typically the con-
tents of the front buffers are displayed on a color monitor while the contents of the
back buffers are invisible. (Monoscopic contexts display only the front left buffer;
stereoscopic contexts display both the front left and the front right buffers.) All
color buffers must have the same number of bitplanes, although an implementation
or context may choose not to provide right buffers, or back buffers at all. Further,
an implementation or context may choose not to provide depth or stencil buffers.
If no default framebuffer is associated with the GL context, the framebuffer is in-
complete except when a framebuffer object is bound (see sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.4).

    Framebuffer objects are not visible, and do not have any of the color buffers
present in the default framebuffer. Instead, the buffers of an framebuffer object
are specified by attaching individual textures or renderbuffers (see section 4.4) to
a set of attachment points. A framebuffer object has an array of color buffer at-
tachment points, numbered zero through n, a depth buffer attachment point, and
a stencil buffer attachment point. In order to be used for rendering, a framebuffer
object must be complete, as described in section 4.4.4. Not all attachments of a
framebuffer object need to be populated.
    Each pixel in a color buffer consists of up to four color components. The four
color components are named R, G, B, and A, in that order; color buffers are not
required to have all four color components. R, G, B, and A components may be
represented as signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point, floating-point, or signed
or unsigned integer values; all components must have the same representation.
Each pixel in a depth buffer consists of a single unsigned integer value in the format
described in section 2.13.1 or a floating-point value. Each pixel in a stencil buffer
consists of a single unsigned integer value.
    The number of bitplanes in the color, depth, and stencil buffers is dependent
on the currently bound framebuffer. For the default framebuffer, the number of
bitplanes is fixed. For framebuffer objects, the number of bitplanes in a given
logical buffer may change if the image attached to the corresponding attachment
point changes.
    The GL has two active framebuffers; the draw framebuffer is the destination
for rendering operations, and the read framebuffer is the source for readback op-
erations. The same framebuffer may be used for both drawing and reading. Sec-
tion 4.4.1 describes the mechanism for controlling framebuffer usage.
    The default framebuffer is initially used as the draw and read framebuffer 1 ,
and the initial state of all provided bitplanes is undefined. The format and encod-
ing of buffers in the draw and read framebuffers can be queried as described in
section 6.1.3.


4.1     Per-Fragment Operations
A fragment produced by rasterization with window coordinates of (xw , yw ) mod-
ifies the pixel in the framebuffer at that location based on a number of parame-
ters and conditions. We describe these modifications and tests, diagrammed in

     The window system binding API may allow associating a GL context with two separate “default
framebuffers” provided by the window system as the draw and read framebuffers, but if so, both
default framebuffers are referred to by the name zero at their respective binding points.

modifications and tests.

4.1.1    Pixel Ownership Test
The first test is to determine if the pixel at location (xw , yw ) in the framebuffer
is currently owned by the GL (more precisely, by this GL context). If it is not,
the window system decides the fate the incoming fragment. Possible results are
that the fragment is discarded or that some subset of the subsequent per-fragment
operations are applied to the fragment. This test allows the window system to
control the GL’s behavior, for instance, when a GL window is obscured.
    If the draw framebuffer is a framebuffer object (see section 4.2.1), the pixel
ownership test always passes, since the pixels of framebuffer objects are owned by
the GL, not the window system. If the draw framebuffer is the default framebuffer,
the window system controls pixel ownership.

4.1.2    Scissor Test
The scissor test determines if (xw , yw ) lies within the scissor rectangle defined by
four values. These values are set with


                        OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                   196


        void Scissor( int left, int bottom, sizei width,
           sizei height );

If left ≤ xw < left + width and bottom ≤ yw < bottom + height, then the
scissor test passes. Otherwise, the test fails and the fragment is discarded. The
test is enabled or disabled using Enable or Disable using the constant SCISSOR_-
TEST. When disabled, it is as if the scissor test always passes. If either width or
height is less than zero, then the error INVALID_VALUE is generated. The state
required consists of four integer values and a bit indicating whether the test is
enabled or disabled. In the initial state, left = bottom = 0. width and height are
set to the width and height, respectively, of the window into which the GL is to
do its rendering. If the default framebuffer is bound but no default framebuffer is
associated with the GL context (see chapter 4), then width and height are initially
set to zero. Initially, the scissor test is disabled.

4.1.3    Multisample Fragment Operations
This step modifies fragment alpha and coverage values based on the values
of SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE, SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE, SAMPLE_-
COVERAGE,        SAMPLE_COVERAGE_VALUE,              SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT,
SAMPLE_MASK, and SAMPLE_MASK_VALUE. No changes to the fragment al-
pha or coverage values are made at this step if MULTISAMPLE is disabled, or if the
value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is not one.
    All alpha values in this section refer only to the alpha component of the frag-
ment shader output linked to color number zero, index zero (see section 3.9.2) if
a fragment shader is in use, or the alpha component of the result of fixed-function
fragment shading. If the fragment shader does not write to this output, the alpha
value is undefined.
    SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE, SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE, and SAMPLE_-
COVERAGE are enabled and disabled by calling Enable and Disable with cap
specified as one of the three the desired token value. All three values are queried
by calling IsEnabled with cap set to the desired token value. If drawbuffer zero is
not NONE and the buffer it references has an integer format, the SAMPLE_ALPHA_-
TO_COVERAGE and SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE operations are skipped.
    If SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE is enabled, and the color buffer has a
fixed-point or floating-point format, a temporary coverage value is generated
where each bit is determined by the alpha value at the corresponding sample lo-
cation. The temporary coverage value is then ANDed with the fragment coverage
value to generate a new fragment coverage value. If the fragment shader outputs
an integer to color number zero, index zero when not rendering to an integer for-


                  OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                      197


mat, the coverage value is undefined. Otherwise the fragment coverage value is
unchanged at this point. If multiple colors are written by a fragment shader, the
alpha value of fragment color zero is used to determine the temporary coverage
value.
     No specific algorithm is required for converting the sample alpha values to a
temporary coverage value. It is intended that the number of 1’s in the temporary
coverage be proportional to the set of alpha values for the fragment, with all 1’s
corresponding to the maximum of all alpha values, and all 0’s corresponding to
all alpha values being 0. The alpha values used to generate a coverage value are
clamped to the range [0, 1]. It is also intended that the algorithm be pseudo-random
in nature, to avoid image artifacts due to regular coverage sample locations. The
algorithm can and probably should be different at different pixel locations. If it
does differ, it should be defined relative to window, not screen, coordinates, so that
rendering results are invariant with respect to window position.
     Next, if SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE is enabled, each alpha value is replaced by
the maximum representable alpha value for fixed-point color buffers, or by 1.0 for
floating-point buffers. Otherwise, the alpha values are not changed.
     Next, if SAMPLE_COVERAGE is enabled, the fragment coverage is ANDed with
another temporary coverage. This temporary coverage is generated in the same
manner as the one described above, but as a function of the value of SAMPLE_-
COVERAGE_VALUE. The function need not be identical, but it must have the same
properties of proportionality and invariance. If SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT is
TRUE, the temporary coverage is inverted (all bit values are inverted) before it is
ANDed with the fragment coverage.
     The values of SAMPLE_COVERAGE_VALUE and SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT
are specified by calling

      void SampleCoverage( clampf value, boolean invert );

with value set to the desired coverage value, and invert set to TRUE or FALSE.
value is clamped to [0,1] before being stored as SAMPLE_COVERAGE_VALUE.
SAMPLE_COVERAGE_VALUE is queried by calling GetFloatv with pname set to
SAMPLE_COVERAGE_VALUE. SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT is queried by calling
GetBooleanv with pname set to SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT.
    Finally, if SAMPLE_MASK is enabled, the fragment coverage is ANDed with
the coverage value SAMPLE_MASK_VALUE. The value of SAMPLE_MASK_VALUE is
specified using

      void SampleMaski( uint maskNumber, bitfield mask );



                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                       198


with mask set to the desired mask for mask word maskNumber. SAMPLE_MASK_-
VALUE is queried by calling GetIntegeri v with pname set to SAMPLE_MASK_-
VALUE and the index set to maskNumber. Bit B of mask word M corresponds to
sample 32 × M + B as described in section 3.3.1. The error INVALID_VALUE is
generated if the mask word indexed is greater than or equal to the value of MAX_-
SAMPLE_MASK_WORDS.


4.1.4    Stencil Test
The stencil test conditionally discards a fragment based on the outcome of a com-
parison between the value in the stencil buffer at location (xw , yw ) and a reference
value. The test is enabled or disabled with the Enable and Disable commands,
using the symbolic constant STENCIL_TEST. When disabled, the stencil test and
associated modifications are not made, and the fragment is always passed.
    The stencil test is controlled with

        void StencilFunc( enum func, int ref, uint mask );
        void StencilFuncSeparate( enum face, enum func, int ref,
           uint mask );
        void StencilOp( enum sfail, enum dpfail, enum dppass );
        void StencilOpSeparate( enum face, enum sfail, enum dpfail,
           enum dppass );

    There are two sets of stencil-related state, the front stencil state set and the
back stencil state set. Stencil tests and writes use the front set of stencil state
when processing fragments rasterized from non-polygon primitives (points and
lines) and front-facing polygon primitives while the back set of stencil state is
used when processing fragments rasterized from back-facing polygon primitives.
For the purposes of stencil testing, a primitive is still considered a polygon even if
the polygon is to be rasterized as points or lines due to the current polygon mode.
Whether a polygon is front- or back-facing is determined in the same manner used
for two-sided lighting and face culling (see section 3.6.1).
    StencilFuncSeparate and StencilOpSeparate take a face argument which can
be FRONT, BACK, or FRONT_AND_BACK and indicates which set of state is affected.
StencilFunc and StencilOp set front and back stencil state to identical values.
    StencilFunc and StencilFuncSeparate take three arguments that control
whether the stencil test passes or fails. ref is an integer reference value that is used
in the unsigned stencil comparison. Stencil comparison operations and queries of
ref clamp its value to the range [0, 2s − 1], where s is the number of bits in the
stencil buffer attached to the draw framebuffer. The s least significant bits of mask

4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                        199


are bitwise ANDed with both the reference and the stored stencil value, and the
resulting masked values are those that participate in the comparison controlled by
func. func is a symbolic constant that determines the stencil comparison function;
the eight symbolic constants are NEVER, ALWAYS, LESS, LEQUAL, EQUAL, GEQUAL,
GREATER, or NOTEQUAL. Accordingly, the stencil test passes never, always, and if
the masked reference value is less than, less than or equal to, equal to, greater than
or equal to, greater than, or not equal to the masked stored value in the stencil
buffer.
    StencilOp and StencilOpSeparate take three arguments that indicate what
happens to the stored stencil value if this or certain subsequent tests fail or pass.
sfail indicates what action is taken if the stencil test fails. The symbolic constants
are KEEP, ZERO, REPLACE, INCR, DECR, INVERT, INCR_WRAP, and DECR_WRAP.
These correspond to keeping the current value, setting to zero, replacing with the
reference value, incrementing with saturation, decrementing with saturation, bit-
wise inverting it, incrementing without saturation, and decrementing without satu-
ration.
    For purposes of increment and decrement, the stencil bits are considered as an
unsigned integer. Incrementing or decrementing with saturation clamps the stencil
value at 0 and the maximum representable value. Incrementing or decrementing
without saturation will wrap such that incrementing the maximum representable
value results in 0, and decrementing 0 results in the maximum representable value.
    The same symbolic values are given to indicate the stencil action if the depth
buffer test (see section 4.1.5) fails (dpfail), or if it passes (dppass).
    If the stencil test fails, the incoming fragment is discarded. The state required
consists of the most recent values passed to StencilFunc or StencilFuncSeparate
and to StencilOp or StencilOpSeparate, and a bit indicating whether stencil test-
ing is enabled or disabled. In the initial state, stenciling is disabled, the front and
back stencil reference value are both zero, the front and back stencil comparison
functions are both ALWAYS, and the front and back stencil mask are both set to the
value 2s − 1, where s is greater than or equal to the number of bits in the deepest
stencil buffer supported by the GL implementation. Initially, all three front and
back stencil operations are KEEP.
    If there is no stencil buffer, no stencil modification can occur, and it is as if the
stencil tests always pass, regardless of any calls to StencilFunc.

4.1.5   Depth Buffer Test
The depth buffer test discards the incoming fragment if a depth comparison fails.
The comparison is enabled or disabled with the generic Enable and Disable com-
mands using the symbolic constant DEPTH_TEST. When disabled, the depth com-


                    OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                      200


parison and subsequent possible updates to the depth buffer value are bypassed and
the fragment is passed to the next operation. The stencil value, however, is modi-
fied as indicated below as if the depth buffer test passed. If enabled, the comparison
takes place and the depth buffer and stencil value may subsequently be modified.
    The comparison is specified with

        void DepthFunc( enum func );

This command takes a single symbolic constant: one of NEVER, ALWAYS, LESS,
LEQUAL, EQUAL, GREATER, GEQUAL, NOTEQUAL. Accordingly, the depth buffer
test passes never, always, if the incoming fragment’s zw value is less than, less
than or equal to, equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, or not equal to
the depth value stored at the location given by the incoming fragment’s (xw , yw )
coordinates.
    If depth clamping (see section 2.19) is enabled, before the incoming fragment’s
zw is compared zw is clamped to the range [min(n, f ), max(n, f )], where n and f
are the current near and far depth range values (see section 2.13.1)
    If the depth buffer test fails, the incoming fragment is discarded. The stencil
value at the fragment’s (xw , yw ) coordinates is updated according to the function
currently in effect for depth buffer test failure. Otherwise, the fragment continues
to the next operation and the value of the depth buffer at the fragment’s (xw , yw )
location is set to the fragment’s zw value. In this case the stencil value is updated
according to the function currently in effect for depth buffer test success.
    The necessary state is an eight-valued integer and a single bit indicating
whether depth buffering is enabled or disabled. In the initial state the function
is LESS and the test is disabled.
    If there is no depth buffer, it is as if the depth buffer test always passes.

4.1.6    Occlusion Queries
Occlusion queries use query objects to track the number of fragments or samples
that pass the depth test. An occlusion query can be started and finished by calling
BeginQuery and EndQuery, respectively, with a target of SAMPLES_PASSED or
ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED.
    When an occlusion query is started with target SAMPLES_PASSED, the
samples-passed count maintained by the GL is set to zero. When an occlusion
query is active, the samples-passed count is incremented for each fragment that
passes the depth test. If the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 0, then the samples-
passed count is incremented by 1 for each fragment. If the value of SAMPLE_-
BUFFERS is 1, then the samples-passed count is incremented by the number of


                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                      201


samples whose coverage bit is set. However, implementations, at their discretion,
may instead increase the samples-passed count by the value of SAMPLES if any
sample in the fragment is covered.
     When an occlusion query finishes and all fragments generated by commands
issued prior to EndQuery have been generated, the samples-passed count is written
to the corresponding query object as the query result value, and the query result for
that object is marked as available.
     If the samples-passed count overflows (exceeds the value 2n − 1, where n is
the number of bits in the samples-passed count), its value becomes undefined. It is
recommended, but not required, that implementations handle this overflow case by
saturating at 2n − 1 and incrementing no further.
     When an occlusion query is started with the target ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED, the
samples-boolean state maintained by the GL is set to FALSE. While that occlusion
query is active, the samples-boolean state is set to TRUE if any fragment or sample
passes the depth test. When the occlusion query finishes, the samples-boolean state
of FALSE or TRUE is written to the corresponding query object as the query result
value, and the query result for that object is marked as available.

4.1.7    Blending
Blending combines the incoming source fragment’s R, G, B, and A values with
the destination R, G, B, and A values stored in the framebuffer at the fragment’s
(xw , yw ) location.
     Source and destination values are combined according to the blend equation,
quadruplets of source and destination weighting factors determined by the blend
functions, and a constant blend color to obtain a new set of R, G, B, and A values,
as described below.
     If the color buffer is fixed-point, the components of the source and destination
values and blend factors are clamped to [0, 1] prior to evaluating the blend equation.
If the color buffer is floating-point, no clamping occurs. The resulting four values
are sent to the next operation.
     Blending applies only if the color buffer has a fixed-point or floating-point
format. If the color buffer has an integer format, proceed to the next operation.
     Blending is enabled or disabled for an individual draw buffer with the com-
mands

        void Enablei( enum target, uint index );
        void Disablei( enum target, uint index );

target is the symbolic constant BLEND and index is an integer i specifying the draw
buffer associated with the symbolic constant DRAW_BUFFERi. If the color buffer

                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                    202


associated with DRAW_BUFFERi is one of FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, or FRONT_-
AND_BACK (specifying multiple color buffers), then the state enabled or disabled is
applicable for all of the buffers. Blending can be enabled or disabled for all draw
buffers using Enable or Disable with the symbolic constant BLEND. If blending
is disabled for a particular draw buffer, or if logical operation on color values is
enabled (section 4.1.10), proceed to the next operation.
    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index is greater than the value of
MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS minus one.
    If multiple fragment colors are being written to multiple buffers (see sec-
tion 4.2.1), blending is computed and applied separately for each fragment color
and the corresponding buffer.

Blend Equation
Blending is controlled by the blend equations, defined by the commands

      void BlendEquation( enum mode );
      void BlendEquationSeparate( enum modeRGB,
         enum modeAlpha );

BlendEquationSeparate argument modeRGB determines the RGB blend func-
tion while modeAlpha determines the alpha blend equation. BlendEquation ar-
gument mode determines both the RGB and alpha blend equations. modeRGB and
modeAlpha must each be one of FUNC_ADD, FUNC_SUBTRACT, FUNC_REVERSE_-
SUBTRACT, MIN, or MAX.
    Signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point destination (framebuffer) com-
ponents are represented as described in section 2.1.5. Constant color compo-
nents, floating-point destination components, and source (fragment) components
are taken to be floating point values. If source components are represented in-
ternally by the GL as fixed-point values, they are also interpreted according to
section 2.1.5.
    Prior to blending, signed and unsigned normalized fixed-point color compo-
nents undergo an implied conversion to floating-point using equations 2.1 and 2.3,
respectively. This conversion must leave the values 0 and 1 invariant. Blending
computations are treated as if carried out in floating-point.
    If FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB is enabled and the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING for the framebuffer attachment corresponding
to the destination buffer is SRGB (see section 6.1.3), the R, G, and B destination
color values (after conversion from fixed-point to floating-point) are considered to
be encoded for the sRGB color space and hence must be linearized prior to their


                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                        203


use in blending. Each R, G, and B component is converted in the same fashion
described for sRGB texture components in section 3.8.17.
    If FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB is disabled or the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING is not SRGB, no linearization is performed.
    The resulting linearized R, G, and B and unmodified A values are recombined
as the destination color used in blending computations.
    Table 4.1 provides the corresponding per-component blend equations for each
mode, whether acting on RGB components for modeRGB or the alpha component
for modeAlpha.
    In the table, the s subscript on a color component abbreviation (R, G, B, or
A) refers to the source color component for an incoming fragment, the d subscript
on a color component abbreviation refers to the destination color component at
the corresponding framebuffer location, and the c subscript on a color component
abbreviation refers to the constant blend color component. A color component ab-
breviation without a subscript refers to the new color component resulting from
blending. Additionally, Sr , Sg , Sb , and Sa are the red, green, blue, and alpha com-
ponents of the source weighting factors determined by the source blend function,
and Dr , Dg , Db , and Da are the red, green, blue, and alpha components of the
destination weighting factors determined by the destination blend function. Blend
functions are described below.

Blend Functions
The weighting factors used by the blend equation are determined by the blend
functions. There are four possible sources for weighting factors. These are the
constant color (Rc , Gc , Bc , Ac ) set with BlendColor (see below), the first source
color (Rs0 , Gs0 , Bs0 , As0 ), the second source color (Rs1 , Gs1 , Bs1 , As1 ), and the
destination color (the existing content of the draw buffer). Additionally the special
constants ZERO and ONE are available as weighting factors. Blend functions are
specified with the commands

      void BlendFuncSeparate( enum srcRGB, enum dstRGB,
        enum srcAlpha, enum dstAlpha );
      void BlendFunc( enum src, enum dst );

    BlendFuncSeparate arguments srcRGB and dstRGB determine the source and
destination RGB blend functions, respectively, while srcAlpha and dstAlpha deter-
mine the source and destination alpha blend functions. BlendFunc argument src

   The possible source and destination blend functions and their corresponding
computed blend factors are summarized in table 4.2.

Dual Source Blending and Multiple Draw Buffers
Blend functions that require the second color input, (Rs1 , Gs1 , Bs1 , As1 ) (SRC1_-
COLOR, SRC1_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC1_COLOR, or ONE_MINUS_SRC1_ALPHA)
may consume hardware resources that could otherwise be used for rendering to
multiple draw buffers. Therefore, the number of draw buffers that can be attached
to a frame buffer may be lower when using dual source blending.
    The maximum number of draw buffers that may be attached to a single frame
buffer when using dual-source blending functions is implementation dependent
and can be queried by calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constant MAX_-
DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS. When using dual source blending, MAX_DUAL_-
SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS should be used in place of MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS to de-
termine the maximum number of draw buffers that may be attached to a single
frame buffer. The value of MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS must be at least
1. If the value of MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS is 1, then dual-source
blending and multiple draw buffers cannot be used simultaneously.
    If either blend function requires the second color input for any draw buffer, and

any draw buffers greater than or equal to the value of MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_-
BUFFERS have values other than NONE, the error INVALID_OPERATION is gener-
ated by DrawArrays and the other drawing commands defined in section 2.8.3.

Generation of Second Color Source for Blending
When using a GLSL fragment shader with dual source blending functions, the
color output varyings are bound to the first and second inputs of a draw buffer using
BindFragDataLocationIndexed as described in the Shader Outputs subsection
of section 3.9.2. Data written to the first of these outputs becomes the first source
color input to the blender (corresponding to SRC_COLOR and SRC_ALPHA). Data
written to the second of these outputs generates the second source color input to
the blender (corresponding to SRC1_COLOR and SRC1_ALPHA).
    If the second color input to the blender is not written in the shader, or if no
output is bound to the second input of a blender, the result of the blending operation
is not defined.

Blend Color
The constant color Cc to be used in blending is specified with the command

      void BlendColor( clampf red, clampf green, clampf blue,
         clampf alpha );

   The constant color can be used in both the source and destination blending
functions.

Blending State
The state required for blending is two integers for the RGB and alpha blend equa-
tions, four integers indicating the source and destination RGB and alpha blending
functions, four floating-point values to store the RGBA constant blend color, and a
bit indicating whether blending is enabled or disabled for each of the MAX_DRAW_-
BUFFERS draw buffers.
     The initial blend equations for RGB and alpha are both FUNC_ADD. The initial
blending functions are ONE for the source RGB and alpha functions and ZERO
for the destination RGB and alpha functions. The initial constant blend color is
(R, G, B, A) = (0, 0, 0, 0). Initially, blending is disabled for all draw buffers.
     The value of the blend enable for draw buffer i can be queried by calling IsEn-
abledi with target BLEND and index i.

    The value of the blend enable for draw buffer zero may also be queried by
calling IsEnabled with the same symbolic constant but no index parameter.
    Blending occurs once for each color buffer currently enabled for blending and
for writing (section 4.2.1) using each buffer’s color for Cd . If a color buffer has no
A value, then Ad is taken to be 1.

4.1.8   sRGB Conversion
If FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB is enabled and the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING for the framebuffer attachment corresponding
to the destination buffer is SRGB (see section 6.1.3), the R, G, and B values after
blending are converted into the non-linear sRGB color space by computing

where cl is the R, G, or B element and cs is the result (effectively converted into an
sRGB color space).
   FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING is not SRGB, then

                                       cs = cl .
     The resulting cs values for R, G, and B, and the unmodified A form a new
RGBA color value. If the color buffer is fixed-point, each component is clamped
to the range [0, 1] and then converted to a fixed-point value using equation 2.4. The
resulting four values are sent to the subsequent dithering operation.

4.1.9   Dithering
Dithering selects between two representable color values or indices. A repre-
sentable value is a value that has an exact representation in the color buffer. Dither-
ing selects, for each color component, either the largest representable color value
(for that particular color component) that is less than or equal to the incoming color
component value, c, or the smallest representable color value that is greater than or
equal to c. The selection may depend on the xw and yw coordinates of the pixel,
as well as on the exact value of c. If one of the two values does not exist, then the
selection defaults to the other value.
    Many dithering selection algorithms are possible, but an individual selection
must depend only on the incoming component value and the fragment’s x and y

4.1. PER-FRAGMENT OPERATIONS                                                      208


window coordinates. If dithering is disabled, then each incoming color component
c is replaced with the largest positive representable color value (for that particular
component) that is less than or equal to c, or by the smallest negative representable
value, if no representable value is less than or equal to c.
     Dithering is enabled with Enable and disabled with Disable using the symbolic
constant DITHER. The state required is thus a single bit. Initially, dithering is
enabled.

4.1.10    Logical Operation
Finally, a logical operation is applied between the incoming fragment’s color val-
ues and the color values stored at the corresponding location in the framebuffer.
The result replaces the values in the framebuffer at the fragment’s (xw , yw ) coordi-
nates. If the selected draw buffers refer to the same framebuffer-attachable image
more than once, then the values stored in that image are undefined.
    The logical operation on color values is enabled or disabled with Enable or
Disable using the symbolic constant COLOR_LOGIC_OP. If the logical operation is
enabled for color values, it is as if blending were disabled, regardless of the value
of BLEND. If multiple fragment colors are being written to multiple buffers (see
section 4.2.1), the logical operation is computed and applied separately for each
fragment color and the corresponding buffer.
    Logical operation has no effect on a floating-point destination color buffer.
However, if logical operation is enabled, blending is still disabled.
    The logical operation is selected by

      void LogicOp( enum op );

op is a symbolic constant; the possible constants and corresponding operations are
enumerated in table 4.3. In this table, s is the value of the incoming fragment and d
is the value stored in the framebuffer. The numeric values assigned to the symbolic
constants are the same as those assigned to the corresponding symbolic values in
the X window system.
     Logical operations are performed independently for each red, green, blue, and
alpha value of each color buffer that is selected for writing. The required state is
an integer indicating the logical operation, and a bit indicating whether the logical
operation is enabled or disabled. The initial state is for the logic operation to be
given by COPY, and to be disabled.

4.1.11    Additional Multisample Fragment Operations
If the DrawBuffer mode is NONE, no change is made to any multisample or color
buffer. Otherwise, fragment processing is as described below.
     If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, the
stencil test, depth test, blending, dithering, and logical operations are performed
for each pixel sample, rather than just once for each fragment. Failure of the sten-
cil or depth test results in termination of the processing of that sample, rather than
discarding of the fragment. All operations are performed on the color, depth, and
stencil values stored in the multisample buffer (to be described in a following sec-
tion). The contents of the color buffers are not modified at this point.
     Stencil, depth, blending, dithering, and logical operations are performed for
a pixel sample only if that sample’s fragment coverage bit is a value of 1. If the
corresponding coverage bit is 0, no operations are performed for that sample.
     If MULTISAMPLE is disabled, and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, the
fragment may be treated exactly as described above, with optimization possible
because the fragment coverage must be set to full coverage. Further optimization
is allowed, however. An implementation may choose to identify a centermost sam-
ple, and to perform stencil and depth tests on only that sample. Regardless of the

outcome of the stencil test, all multisample buffer stencil sample values are set to
the appropriate new stencil value. If the depth test passes, all multisample buffer
depth sample values are set to the depth of the fragment’s centermost sample’s
depth value, and all multisample buffer color sample values are set to the color
value of the incoming fragment. Otherwise, no change is made to any multisample
buffer color or depth value.
     After all operations have been completed on the multisample buffer, the sample
values for each color in the multisample buffer are combined to produce a single
color value, and that value is written into the corresponding color buffers selected
by DrawBuffer or DrawBuffers. An implementation may defer the writing of
the color buffers until a later time, but the state of the framebuffer must behave
as if the color buffers were updated as each fragment was processed. The method
of combination is not specified. If the framebuffer contains sRGB values, then it
is recommended that the an average of sample values is computed in a linearized
space, as for blending (see section 4.1.7). Otherwise, a simple average computed
independently for each color component is recommended.


4.2     Whole Framebuffer Operations
The preceding sections described the operations that occur as individual fragments
are sent to the framebuffer. This section describes operations that control or affect
the whole framebuffer.

4.2.1    Selecting a Buffer for Writing
The first such operation is controlling the color buffers into which each of the
fragment color values is written. This is accomplished with either DrawBuffer or
DrawBuffers.
    The command

        void DrawBuffer( enum buf );

defines the set of color buffers to which fragment color zero is written. buf
must be one of the values from tables 4.4 or 4.5. In addition, acceptable val-
ues for buf depend on whether the GL is using the default framebuffer (i.e.,
DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is zero), or a framebuffer object (i.e., DRAW_-
FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero). In the initial state, the GL is bound to
the default framebuffer. For more information about framebuffer objects, see sec-
tion 4.4.

4.2. WHOLE FRAMEBUFFER OPERATIONS                                                  211


     If the GL is bound to the default framebuffer, then buf must be one of the values
listed in table 4.4, which summarizes the constants and the buffers they indicate.
In this case, buf is a symbolic constant specifying zero, one, two, or four buffers
for writing. These constants refer to the four potentially visible buffers (front left,
front right, back left, and back right). Arguments that omit reference to LEFT or
RIGHT refer to both left and right buffers. Arguments that omit reference to FRONT
or BACK refer to both front and back buffers.
     If the GL is bound to a framebuffer object, buf must be one of the values listed
in table 4.5, which summarizes the constants and the buffers they indicate. In
this case, buf is a symbolic constant specifying a single color buffer for writing.
Specifying COLOR_ATTACHMENTi enables drawing only to the image attached to
the framebuffer at COLOR_ATTACHMENTi. Each COLOR_ATTACHMENTi adheres to
COLOR_ATTACHMENTi = COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 + i. The intial value of DRAW_-
BUFFER for framebuffer objects is COLOR_ATTACHMENT0.
     If the GL is bound to the default framebuffer and DrawBuffer is supplied with
a constant (other than NONE) that does not indicate any of the color buffers allocated
to the GL context, the error INVALID_OPERATION results.
     If the GL is bound to a framebuffer object and buf is one of the constants
from table 4.4, then the error INVALID_OPERATION results. If buf is COLOR_-
ATTACHMENTm and m is greater than or equal to the value of MAX_COLOR_-
ATTACHMENTS, then the error INVALID_VALUE results.
     If DrawBuffer is supplied with a constant that is legal for neither the default
framebuffer nor a framebuffer object, then the error INVALID_ENUM results.
     DrawBuffer will set the draw buffer for fragment colors other than zero to
NONE.
     The command

      void DrawBuffers( sizei n, const enum *bufs );

defines the draw buffers to which all fragment colors are written. n specifies the
number of buffers in bufs. bufs is a pointer to an array of symbolic constants
specifying the buffer to which each fragment color is written.
    Each buffer listed in bufs must be one of the values from tables 4.5 or 4.6. Oth-
erwise, an INVALID_ENUM error is generated. Further, acceptable values for the
constants in bufs depend on whether the GL is using the default framebuffer (i.e.,
DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is zero), or a framebuffer object (i.e., DRAW_-
FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero). For more information about framebuffer
objects, see section 4.4.
    If the GL is bound to the default framebuffer, then each of the constants must
be one of the values listed in table 4.6.

     If the GL is bound to an framebuffer object, then each of the constants must be
one of the values listed in table 4.5.
     In both cases, the draw buffers being defined correspond in order to the re-
spective fragment colors. The draw buffer for fragment colors beyond n is set to
NONE.
     The maximum number of draw buffers is implementation-dependent. The
number of draw buffers supported can be queried by calling GetIntegerv with the
symbolic constant MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS. An INVALID_VALUE error is generated
if n is greater than MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.
     Except for NONE, a buffer may not appear more then once in the array pointed
to by bufs. Specifying a buffer more then once will result in the error INVALID_-
OPERATION.
     If a fragment shader writes to gl_FragColor, DrawBuffers specifies a set
of draw buffers into which the single fragment color defined by gl_FragColor
is written. If a fragment shader writes to gl_FragData, or a user-defined vary-
ing out variable, DrawBuffers specifies a set of draw buffers into which each of
the multiple output colors defined by these variables are separately written. If a
fragment shader writes to none of gl_FragColor, gl_FragData, nor any user-
defined varying out variables, the values of the fragment colors following shader
execution are undefined, and may differ for each fragment color.
     For both the default framebuffer and framebuffer objects, the constants FRONT,
BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, and FRONT_AND_BACK are not valid in the bufs array passed
to DrawBuffers, and will result in the error INVALID_ENUM. This restriction is
because these constants may themselves refer to multiple buffers, as shown in ta-
ble 4.4.
     If the GL is bound to the default framebuffer and DrawBuffers is supplied with
a constant (other than NONE) that does not indicate any of the color buffers allocated
to the GL context by the window system, the error INVALID_OPERATION will be
generated.
     If the GL is bound to a framebuffer object and DrawBuffers is supplied with
a constant from table 4.6, or COLOR_ATTACHMENTm where m is greater than
or equal to the value of MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS, then the error INVALID_-
OPERATION results.
     Indicating a buffer or buffers using DrawBuffer or DrawBuffers causes sub-
sequent pixel color value writes to affect the indicated buffers.
     Specifying NONE as the draw buffer for a fragment color will inhibit that frag-
ment color from being written to any buffer.
     Monoscopic contexts include only left buffers, while stereoscopic contexts in-
clude both left and right buffers. Likewise, single buffered contexts include only
front buffers, while double buffered contexts include both front and back buffers.

The type of context is selected at GL initialization.
    The state required to handle color buffer selection for each framebuffer is an
integer for each supported fragment color. For the default framebuffer, in the initial
state the draw buffer for fragment color zero is BACK if there is a back buffer;
FRONT if there is no back buffer; and NONE if no default framebuffer is associated
with the context. For framebuffer objects, in the initial state the draw buffer for
fragment color zero is COLOR_ATTACHMENT0. For both the default framebuffer
and framebuffer objects, the initial state of draw buffers for fragment colors other
then zero is NONE.
    The value of the draw buffer selected for fragment color i can be queried by
calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constant DRAW_BUFFERi. DRAW_BUFFER
is equivalent to DRAW_BUFFER0.

4.2.2    Fine Control of Buffer Updates
Writing of bits to each of the logical framebuffers after all per-fragment operations
have been performed may be masked. The commands

        void ColorMask( boolean r, boolean g, boolean b,
           boolean a );
        void ColorMaski( uint buf, boolean r, boolean g,
           boolean b, boolean a );

control writes to the active draw buffers.
     ColorMask and ColorMaski are used to mask the writing of R, G, B and A
values to the draw buffer or buffers. ColorMaski sets the mask for a particular
draw buffer. The mask for DRAW_BUFFERi is modified by passing i as the pa-
rameter buf. r, g, b, and a indicate whether R, G, B, or A values, respectively,
are written or not (a value of TRUE means that the corresponding value is writ-
ten). The mask specified by r, g, b, and a is applied to the color buffer associated
with DRAW_BUFFERi. If DRAW_BUFFERi is one of FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, or
FRONT_AND_BACK (specifying multiple color buffers) then the mask is applied to
all of the buffers.
     ColorMask sets the mask for all draw buffers to the same values as specified
by r, g, b, and a.
     An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index is greater than the value of
MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS minus one.
     In the initial state, all color values are enabled for writing for all draw buffers.
     The value of the color writemask for draw buffer i can be queried by calling
GetBooleani v with target COLOR_WRITEMASK and index i. The value of the color

4.2. WHOLE FRAMEBUFFER OPERATIONS                                                           215


writemask for draw buffer zero may also be queried by calling GetBooleanv with
the symbolic constant COLOR_WRITEMASK.
    The depth buffer can be enabled or disabled for writing zw values using

      void DepthMask( boolean mask );

If mask is non-zero, the depth buffer is enabled for writing; otherwise, it is disabled.
In the initial state, the depth buffer is enabled for writing.
    The commands

      void StencilMask( uint mask );
      void StencilMaskSeparate( enum face, uint mask );

control the writing of particular bits into the stencil planes.
     The least significant s bits of mask, where s is the number of bits in the stencil
buffer, specify an integer mask. Where a 1 appears in this mask, the corresponding
bit in the stencil buffer is written; where a 0 appears, the bit is not written. The face
parameter of StencilMaskSeparate can be FRONT, BACK, or FRONT_AND_BACK
and indicates whether the front or back stencil mask state is affected. StencilMask
sets both front and back stencil mask state to identical values.
     Fragments generated by front-facing primitives use the front mask and frag-
ments generated by back-facing primitives use the back mask (see section 4.1.4).
The clear operation always uses the front stencil write mask when clearing the
stencil buffer.
     The state required for the various masking operations is two integers for the
front and back stencil values, and a bit for depth values. A set of four bits is also
required indicating which color components of an RGBA value should be written.
In the initial state, the integer masks are all ones, as are the bits controlling depth
value and RGBA component writing.

Fine Control of Multisample Buffer Updates
When the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, ColorMask, DepthMask, and Sten-
cilMask or StencilMaskSeparate control the modification of values in the multi-
sample buffer. The color mask has no effect on modifications to the color buffers.
If the color mask is entirely disabled, the color sample values must still be com-
bined (as described above) and the result used to replace the color values of the
buffers enabled by DrawBuffer.

4.2.3    Clearing the Buffers
The GL provides a means for setting portions of every pixel in a particular buffer
to the same value. The argument to

        void Clear( bitfield buf );

is zero or the bitwise OR of one or more values indicating which buffers are
to be cleared. The values are COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT, and
STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT, indicating the buffers currently enabled for color writ-
ing, the depth buffer, and the stencil buffer (see below), respectively. The value to
which each buffer is cleared depends on the setting of the clear value for that buffer.
If buf is zero, no buffers are cleared. If buf contains any bits other than COLOR_-
BUFFER_BIT, DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT, or STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT, then the error
INVALID_VALUE is generated.

        void ClearColor( clampf r, clampf g, clampf b,
           clampf a );

sets the clear value for fixed- and floating-point color buffers. The specified com-
ponents are stored as floating-point values.
    The command

        void ClearDepth( clampd d );

sets the depth value used when clearing the depth buffer. d is clamped to the
range [0, 1]. When clearing a fixed-point depth buffer, d is converted to fixed-point
according to the rules for a window z value given in section 2.13.1. No conversion
is applied when clearing a floating-point depth buffer.
    The command

        void ClearStencil( int s );

takes a single integer argument that is the value to which to clear the stencil buffer.
s is masked to the number of bitplanes in the stencil buffer.
     When Clear is called, the only per-fragment operations that are applied (if
enabled) are the pixel ownership test, the scissor test, and dithering. The masking
operations described in section 4.2.2 are also applied. If a buffer is not present,
then a Clear directed at that buffer has no effect. Unsigned normalized fixed-point
and signed normalized fixed-point RGBA color buffers are cleared to color values
derived by clamping each component of the clear color to the range [0, 1] or [−1, 1]


                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010

respectively, then converting to fixed-point using equations 2.4 or 2.6, respectively.
The result of clearing integer color buffers is undefined.
    The state required for clearing is a clear value for each of the color buffer,
the depth buffer, and the stencil buffer. Initially, the RGBA color clear value is
(0, 0, 0, 0), the depth buffer clear value is 1.0, and the stencil buffer clear index is
0.
    Individual buffers of the currently bound draw framebuffer may be cleared with
the command

      void ClearBuffer{if ui}v( enum buffer, int drawbuffer,
         const T *value );

where buffer and drawbuffer identify a buffer to clear, and value specifies the value
or values to clear it to.
    If buffer is COLOR, a particular draw buffer DRAW_BUFFERi is specified by
passing i as the parameter drawbuffer, and value points to a four-element vec-
tor specifying the R, G, B, and A color to clear that draw buffer to. If the draw
buffer is one of FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, or FRONT_AND_BACK, identifying
multiple buffers, each selected buffer is cleared to the same value. The Clear-
Bufferfv, ClearBufferiv, and ClearBufferuiv commands should be used to clear
fixed- and floating-point, signed integer, and unsigned integer color buffers respec-
tively. Clamping and conversion for fixed-point color buffers are performed in the
same fashion as ClearColor.
    If buffer is DEPTH, drawbuffer must be zero, and value points to the single
depth value to clear the depth buffer to. Clamping and type conversion for fixed-
point depth buffers are performed in the same fashion as ClearDepth. Only Clear-
Bufferfv should be used to clear depth buffers.
    If buffer is STENCIL, drawbuffer must be zero, and value points to the single
stencil value to clear the stencil buffer to. Masking and type conversion are per-
formed in the same fashion as ClearStencil. Only ClearBufferiv should be used
to clear stencil buffers.
    The command

      void ClearBufferfi( enum buffer, int drawbuffer,
         float depth, int stencil );

clears both depth and stencil buffers of the currently bound draw framebuffer.
buffer must be DEPTH_STENCIL and drawbuffer must be zero. depth and sten-
cil are the values to clear the depth and stencil buffers to, respectively. Clamping
and type conversion of depth for fixed-point depth buffers is performed in the same

4.3. READING AND COPYING PIXELS                                                  218


fashion as ClearDepth. Masking of stencil for stencil buffers is performed in the
same fashion as ClearStencil. ClearBufferfi is equivalent to clearing the depth
and stencil buffers separately, but may be faster when a buffer of internal format
DEPTH_STENCIL is being cleared.
    The result of ClearBuffer is undefined if no conversion between the type of
the specified value and the type of the buffer being cleared is defined (for example,
if ClearBufferiv is called for a fixed- or floating-point buffer, or if ClearBufferfv
is called for a signed or unsigned integer buffer). This is not an error.
    When ClearBuffer is called, the same per-fragment and masking operations
defined for Clear are applied.
Errors
    ClearBuffer{if ui}v generates an INVALID_ENUM error if buffer is not COLOR,
DEPTH, or STENCIL. ClearBufferfi generates an INVALID_ENUM error if buffer is
not DEPTH_STENCIL.
    ClearBuffer generates an INVALID_VALUE error if buffer is COLOR and draw-
buffer is less than zero, or greater than the value of MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS minus
one; or if buffer is DEPTH, STENCIL, or DEPTH_STENCIL and drawbuffer is not
zero.

Clearing the Multisample Buffer
The color samples of the multisample buffer are cleared when one or more color
buffers are cleared, as specified by the Clear mask bit COLOR_BUFFER_BIT and
the DrawBuffer mode. If the DrawBuffer mode is NONE, the color samples of the
multisample buffer cannot be cleared using Clear.
     If the Clear mask bits DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT or STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT are
set, then the corresponding depth or stencil samples, respectively, are cleared.
     The ClearBuffer commands also clear color, depth, or stencil samples of mul-
tisample buffers corresponding to the specified buffer.


4.3     Reading and Copying Pixels
    Pixels may be read from the framebuffer using ReadPixels. BlitFramebuffer
can be used to copy a block of pixels from one portion of the framebuffer to another.

4.3.1   Reading Pixels
The method for reading pixels from the framebuffer and placing them in pixel pack
buffer or client memory is diagrammed in figure 4.2. We describe the stages of the
pixel reading process in the order in which they occur.

    Initially, zero is bound for the PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, indicating that image
read and query commands such as ReadPixels return pixel results into client mem-
ory pointer parameters. However, if a non-zero buffer object is bound as the current
pixel pack buffer, then the pointer parameter is treated as an offset into the desig-
nated buffer object.
    Pixels are read using

      void ReadPixels( int x, int y, sizei width, sizei height,
         enum format, enum type, void *data );

The arguments after x and y to ReadPixels are described in section 3.7.2. The pixel
storage modes that apply to ReadPixels and other commands that query images
(see section 6.1) are summarized in table 4.7.
    ReadPixels          generates     an       INVALID_OPERATION              error
if READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING (see section 4.4) is non-zero, the read frame-
buffer is framebuffer complete, and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS for the read
framebuffer is greater than zero.

Obtaining Pixels from the Framebuffer
If the format is DEPTH_COMPONENT, then values are obtained from the depth buffer.
If there is no depth buffer, the error INVALID_OPERATION occurs.
     If there is a multisample buffer (the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one), then
values are obtained from the depth samples in this buffer. It is recommended that
the depth value of the centermost sample be used, though implementations may
choose any function of the depth sample values at each pixel.
     If the format is DEPTH_STENCIL, then values are taken from both the depth
buffer and the stencil buffer. If there is no depth buffer or if there is no stencil
buffer, then the error INVALID_OPERATION occurs. If the type parameter is not
UNSIGNED_INT_24_8 or FLOAT_32_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8_REV, then the error
INVALID_ENUM occurs.
     If there is a multisample buffer, then values are obtained from the depth and
stencil samples in this buffer. It is recommended that the depth and stencil values of
the centermost sample be used, though implementations may choose any function
of the depth and stencil sample values at each pixel.
     If the format is STENCIL_INDEX, then values are taken from the stencil buffer;
again, if there is no stencil buffer, the error INVALID_OPERATION occurs.
     If there is a multisample buffer, then values are obtained from the stencil sam-
ples in this buffer. It is recommended that the stencil value of the centermost sam-
ple be used, though implementations may choose any function of the stencil sample
values at each pixel.
     For all other formats, the read buffer from which values are obtained is one of
the color buffers; the selection of color buffer is controlled with ReadBuffer.
     The command

4.3. READING AND COPYING PIXELS                                                  221


      void ReadBuffer( enum src );

takes a symbolic constant as argument. src must be one of the values from ta-
bles 4.4 or 4.5. Otherwise, an INVALID_ENUM error is generated. Further, the
acceptable values for src depend on whether the GL is using the default frame-
buffer (i.e., READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is zero), or a framebuffer object (i.e.,
READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero). For more information about frame-
buffer objects, see section 4.4.
     If the object bound to READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is not framebuffer com-
plete (as defined in section 4.4.4), then ReadPixels generates the error INVALID_-
FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION. If ReadBuffer is supplied with a constant that is nei-
ther legal for the default framebuffer, nor legal for a framebuffer object, then the
error INVALID_ENUM results.
     When READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is zero, i.e. the default framebuffer, src
must be one of the values listed in table 4.4, including NONE. FRONT_AND_BACK,
FRONT, and LEFT refer to the front left buffer, BACK refers to the back left buffer,
and RIGHT refers to the front right buffer. The other constants correspond directly
to the buffers that they name. If the requested buffer is missing, then the error
INVALID_OPERATION is generated. For the default framebuffer, the initial setting
for ReadBuffer is FRONT if there is no back buffer and BACK otherwise.
     When the GL is using a framebuffer object, src must be one of the values listed
in table 4.5, including NONE. In a manner analogous to how the DRAW_BUFFERs
state is handled, specifying COLOR_ATTACHMENTi enables reading from the image
attached to the framebuffer at COLOR_ATTACHMENTi. For framebuffer objects, the
initial setting for ReadBuffer is COLOR_ATTACHMENT0.
     ReadPixels generates an INVALID_OPERATION error if it attempts to select a
color buffer while READ_BUFFER is NONE.
     ReadPixels obtains values from the selected buffer from each pixel with lower
left hand corner at (x + i, y + j) for 0 ≤ i < width and 0 ≤ j < height;
this pixel is said to be the ith pixel in the jth row. If any of these pixels lies
outside of the window allocated to the current GL context, or outside of the image
attached to the currently bound framebuffer object, then the values obtained for
those pixels are undefined. When READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is zero, values
are also undefined for individual pixels that are not owned by the current context.
Otherwise, ReadPixels obtains values from the selected buffer, regardless of how
those values were placed there.
     If format is one of RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, RG, RGB, RGBA, BGR, or BGRA,
then red, green, blue, and alpha values are obtained from the selected buffer at each
pixel location. If the framebuffer does not support alpha values then the A that is
obtained is 1.0.

4.3. READING AND COPYING PIXELS                                                    222


    If format is an integer format and the color buffer is not an integer format; if the
color buffer is an integer format and format is not an integer format; or if format
is an integer format and type is FLOAT or HALF_FLOAT, the error INVALID_-
OPERATION occurs.
    When READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero, the red, green, blue, and
alpha values are obtained by first reading the internal component values of the
corresponding value in the image attached to the selected logical buffer. Internal
components are converted to an RGBA color by taking each R, G, B, and A com-
ponent present according to the base internal format of the buffer (as shown in
table 3.11). If G, B, or A values are not present in the internal format, they are
taken to be zero, zero, and one respectively.

Conversion of RGBA values
This step applies only if format is not STENCIL_INDEX, DEPTH_COMPONENT, or
DEPTH_STENCIL. The R, G, B, and A values form a group of elements.
     For a signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point color buffer, each element is
converted to floating-point using equations 2.3 or 2.1, respectively. For an integer
or floating-point color buffer, the elements are unmodified.

Conversion of Depth values
This step applies only if format is DEPTH_COMPONENT or DEPTH_STENCIL and
the depth buffer uses a fixed-point representation. An element is taken to be a
fixed-point value in [0, 1] with m bits, where m is the number of bits in the depth
buffer (see section 2.13.1). No conversion is necessary if the depth buffer uses a
floating-point representation.

Final Conversion
For an index, if the type is not FLOAT or HALF_FLOAT, final conversion consists
of masking the index with the value given in table 4.8; if the type is FLOAT or
HALF_FLOAT, then the integer index is converted to a GL float or half data
value.
    Read color clamping is controlled by calling
      void ClampColor( enum target, enum clamp );
with target set to CLAMP_READ_COLOR. If clamp is TRUE, read color clamping is
enabled; if clamp is FALSE, read color clamping is disabled. If clamp is FIXED_-
ONLY, read color clamping is enabled if the selected read color buffer has fixed-
point components.

   For a floating-point RGBA color, if type is not one of FLOAT, HALF_FLOAT,
UNSIGNED_INT_5_9_9_9_REV, or UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV; or if
read color clamping is enabled, each component is first clamped to [0, 1]. Then the
appropriate conversion formula from table 4.9 is applied to the component.
    In the special case of calling ReadPixels with type of UNSIGNED_INT_10F_-
11F_11F_REV and format of RGB, conversion is performed as follows: the returned
data are packed into a series of uint values. The red, green, and blue components
are converted to unsigned 11-bit floating-point, unsigned 11-bit floating-point, and
unsigned 10-bit floating point as described in sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4. The result-
ing red 11 bits, green 11 bits, and blue 10 bits are then packed as the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd components of the UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV format as shown in
table 3.8.
    In the special case of calling ReadPixels with type of UNSIGNED_INT_5_-
9_9_9_REV and format RGB, the conversion is performed as follows: the returned
data are packed into a series of uint values. The red, green, and blue compo-
nents are converted to reds , greens , blues , and expshared integers as described
in section 3.8.3 when internalformat is RGB9_E5. The reds , greens , blues ,
and expshared are then packed as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th components of the
UNSIGNED_INT_5_9_9_9_REV format as shown in table 3.8.
    For an integer RGBA color, each component is clamped to the representable
range of type.

Table 4.9: Reversed component conversions, used when component data are being
returned to client memory. Color, normal, and depth components are converted
from the internal floating-point representation (f ) to a datum of the specified GL
data type (c) using the specified equation. All arithmetic is done in the internal
floating point format. These conversions apply to component data returned by GL
query commands and to components of pixel data returned to client memory. The
equations remain the same even if the implemented ranges of the GL data types are
greater than the minimum required ranges. (See table 2.2.) Equations with N as
the exponent are performed for each bitfield of the packed data type, with N set to
the number of bits in the bitfield.

packed into the buffer relative to this offset; otherwise, data is a pointer to a block
client memory and the pixels are packed into the client memory relative to the
pointer. If a pixel pack buffer object is bound and packing the pixel data according
to the pixel pack storage state would access memory beyond the size of the pixel
pack buffer’s memory size, an INVALID_OPERATION error results. If a pixel pack
buffer object is bound and data is not evenly divisible by the number of basic
machine units needed to store in memory the corresponding GL data type from
table 3.2 for the type parameter, an INVALID_OPERATION error results.
    Groups of elements are placed in memory just as they are taken from mem-
ory when transferring pixel rectangles to the GL. That is, the ith group of the jth
row (corresponding to the ith pixel in the jth row) is placed in memory just where
the ith group of the jth row would be taken from when transferring pixels. See
Unpacking under section 3.7.2. The only difference is that the storage mode pa-
rameters whose names begin with PACK_ are used instead of those whose names
begin with UNPACK_. If the format is RED, GREEN, BLUE, or ALPHA, only the
corresponding single element is written. Likewise if the format is RG, RGB, or
BGR, only the corresponding two or three elements are written. Otherwise all the
elements of each group are written.

4.3.2    Copying Pixels
The command

        void BlitFramebuffer( int srcX0, int srcY0, int srcX1,
           int srcY1, int dstX0, int dstY0, int dstX1, int dstY1,
           bitfield mask, enum filter );

transfers a rectangle of pixel values from one region of the read framebuffer to
another in the draw framebuffer.
    mask is the bitwise OR of a number of values indicating which buffers are
to be copied. The values are COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT, and
STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT, which are described in section 4.2.3. The pixels corre-
sponding to these buffers are copied from the source rectangle bounded by the lo-
cations (srcX0, srcY 0) and (srcX1, srcY 1) to the destination rectangle bounded
by the locations (dstX0, dstY 0) and (dstX1, dstY 1). The lower bounds of the
rectangle are inclusive, while the upper bounds are exclusive.
    When the color buffer is transferred, values are taken from the read buffer of the
read framebuffer and written to each of the draw buffers of the draw framebuffer.
    The actual region taken from the read framebuffer is limited to the intersection
of the source buffers being transferred, which may include the color buffer selected

4.3. READING AND COPYING PIXELS                                                    226


by the read buffer, the depth buffer, and/or the stencil buffer depending on mask.
The actual region written to the draw framebuffer is limited to the intersection of
the destination buffers being written, which may include multiple draw buffers,
the depth buffer, and/or the stencil buffer depending on mask. Whether or not the
source or destination regions are altered due to these limits, the scaling and offset
applied to pixels being transferred is performed as though no such limits were
present.
    If the source and destination rectangle dimensions do not match, the source im-
age is stretched to fit the destination rectangle. filter must be LINEAR or NEAREST,
and specifies the method of interpolation to be applied if the image is stretched.
LINEAR filtering is allowed only for the color buffer; if mask includes DEPTH_-
BUFFER_BIT or STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT, and filter is not NEAREST, no copy is
performed and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated. If the source and
destination dimensions are identical, no filtering is applied. If either the source or
destination rectangle specifies a negative width or height (X1 < X0 or Y 1 < Y 0),
the image is reversed in the corresponding direction. If both the source and des-
tination rectangles specify a negative width or height for the same direction, no
reversal is performed. If a linear filter is selected and the rules of LINEAR sam-
pling would require sampling outside the bounds of a source buffer, it is as though
CLAMP_TO_EDGE texture sampling were being performed. If a linear filter is se-
lected and sampling would be required outside the bounds of the specified source
region, but within the bounds of a source buffer, the implementation may choose
to clamp while sampling or not.
    If the source and destination buffers are identical, and the source and destina-
tion rectangles overlap, the result of the blit operation is undefined.
    Blit operations bypass the fragment pipeline. The only fragment operations
which affect a blit are the pixel ownership test and the scissor test.
    If the read framebuffer is layered (see section 4.4.7), pixel values are read from
layer zero. If the draw framebuffer is layered, pixel values are written to layer zero.
If both read and draw framebuffers are layered, the blit operation is still performed
only on layer zero.
    If a buffer is specified in mask and does not exist in both the read and draw
framebuffers, the corresponding bit is silently ignored.
    If the color formats of the read and draw buffers do not match, and mask in-
cludes COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, pixel groups are converted to match the destination
format. However, colors are clamped only if all draw color buffers have fixed-
point components. Format conversion is not supported for all data types, and an
INVALID_OPERATION error is generated under any of the following conditions:

   • The read buffer contains fixed-point or floating-point values and any draw

                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
4.3. READING AND COPYING PIXELS                                                 227


      buffer contains neither fixed-point nor floating-point values.

   • The read buffer contains unsigned integer values and any draw buffer does
     not contain unsigned integer values.

   • The read buffer contains signed integer values and any draw buffer does not
     contain signed integer values.

    Calling BlitFramebuffer will result in an INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_-
OPERATION error if the objects bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING and
READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING are not framebuffer complete (section 4.4.4).
    Calling BlitFramebuffer will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error if mask
includes DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT or STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT, and the source and
destination depth and stencil buffer formats do not match.
    Calling BlitFramebuffer will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error if filter
is LINEAR and read buffer contains integer data.
    If SAMPLE_BUFFERS for the read framebuffer is greater than zero and
SAMPLE_BUFFERS for the draw framebuffer is zero, the samples corresponding
to each pixel location in the source are converted to a single sample before being
written to the destination.
    If SAMPLE_BUFFERS for the read framebuffer is zero and SAMPLE_BUFFERS
for the draw framebuffer is greater than zero, the value of the source sample is
replicated in each of the destination samples.
    If SAMPLE_BUFFERS for either the read framebuffer or draw framebuffer is
greater than zero, no copy is performed and an INVALID_OPERATION error is
generated if the dimensions of the source and destination rectangles provided to
BlitFramebuffer are not identical, if the formats of the read and draw framebuffers
are not identical, or if the values of SAMPLES for the read and draw buffers are not
identical.
    If SAMPLE_BUFFERS for both the read and draw framebuffers are greater than
zero, and the values of SAMPLES for the read and draw framebuffers are identical,
the samples are copied without modification from the read framebuffer to the draw
framebuffer. Otherwise, no copy is performed and an INVALID_OPERATION error
is generated. Note that the samples in the draw buffer are not guaranteed to be at
the same sample location as the read buffer, so rendering using this newly created
buffer can potentially have geometry cracks or incorrect antialiasing. This may
occur if the sizes of the framebuffers do not match, if the formats differ, or if
the source and destination rectangles are not defined with the same (X0, Y 0) and
(X1, Y 1) bounds.

4.3.3   Pixel Draw/Read State
The state required for pixel operations consists of the parameters that are set with
PixelStore, This state has been summarized in tables 3.1, Additional state in-
cludes an integer indicating the current setting of ReadBuffer, and a three-valued
integer controlling clamping during final conversion. For the default framebuffer,
in the initial state the read buffer is BACK if there is a back buffer; FRONT if there is
no back buffer; and NONE if no default framebuffer is associated with the context.
The initial value of read color clamping is FIXED_ONLY. State set with PixelStore
is GL client state.


4.4     Framebuffer Objects
As described in chapter 1 and section 2.1, the GL renders into (and reads values
from) a framebuffer. GL defines two classes of framebuffers: window system-
provided and application-created.
     Initially, the GL uses the default framebuffer. The storage, dimensions, allo-
cation, and format of the images attached to this framebuffer are managed entirely
by the window system. Consequently, the state of the default framebuffer, includ-
ing its images, can not be changed by the GL, nor can the default framebuffer be
deleted by the GL.
     The routines described in the following sections, however, can be used to cre-
ate, destroy, and modify the state and attachments of framebuffer objects.
     Framebuffer objects encapsulate the state of a framebuffer in a similar manner
to the way texture objects encapsulate the state of a texture. In particular, a frame-
buffer object encapsulates state necessary to describe a collection of color, depth,
and stencil logical buffers (other types of buffers are not allowed). For each logical
buffer, a framebuffer-attachable image can be attached to the framebuffer to store
the rendered output for that logical buffer. Examples of framebuffer-attachable im-
ages include texture images and renderbuffer images. Renderbuffers are described
further in section 4.4.2
     By allowing the images of a renderbuffer to be attached to a framebuffer, the
GL provides a mechanism to support off-screen rendering. Further, by allowing the
images of a texture to be attached to a framebuffer, the GL provides a mechanism
to support render to texture.

4.4.1   Binding and Managing Framebuffer Objects
The default framebuffer for rendering and readback operations is provided by the
window system. In addition, named framebuffer objects can be created and oper-

4.4. FRAMEBUFFER OBJECTS                                                            229


ated upon. The namespace for framebuffer objects is the unsigned integers, with
zero reserved by the GL for the default framebuffer.
    A framebuffer object is created by binding a name returned by GenFrame-
buffers (see below) to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER or READ_FRAMEBUFFER. The bind-
ing is effected by calling
      void BindFramebuffer( enum target, uint framebuffer );
with target set to the desired framebuffer target and framebuffer set to the frame-
buffer object name. The resulting framebuffer object is a new state vector, com-
prising all the state values listed in table 6.23, as well as one set of the state values
listed in table 6.24 for each attachment point of the framebuffer, set to the same
initial values. There are MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS color attachment points, plus
one each for the depth and stencil attachment points.
     BindFramebuffer may also be used to bind an existing framebuffer object
to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER and/or READ_FRAMEBUFFER. If the bind is successful no
change is made to the state of the bound framebuffer object, and any previous
binding to target is broken.
     BindFramebuffer fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if
framebuffer is not zero or a name returned from a previous call to GenFrame-
buffers, or if such a name has since been deleted with DeleteFramebuffers.
     If a framebuffer object is bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER or READ_-
FRAMEBUFFER, it becomes the target for rendering or readback operations, respec-
tively, until it is deleted or another framebuffer is bound to the corresponding bind
point. Calling BindFramebuffer with target set to FRAMEBUFFER binds frame-
buffer to both the draw and read targets.
     While a framebuffer object is bound, GL operations on the target to which it
is bound affect the images attached to the bound framebuffer object, and queries
of the target to which it is bound return state from the bound object. Queries of
the values specified in tables 6.48 and 6.26 are derived from the framebuffer object
bound to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.
     The initial state of DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER and READ_FRAMEBUFFER refers to
the default framebuffer. In order that access to the default framebuffer is not lost,
it is treated as a framebuffer object with the name of zero. The default framebuffer
is therefore rendered to and read from while zero is bound to the corresponding
targets. On some implementations, the properties of the default framebuffer can
change over time (e.g., in response to window system events such as attaching the
context to a new window system drawable.)
     Framebuffer objects (those with a non-zero name) differ from the default
framebuffer in a few important ways. First and foremost, unlike the default frame-
buffer, framebuffer objects have modifiable attachment points for each logical

buffer in the framebuffer. Framebuffer-attachable images can be attached to and
detached from these attachment points, which are described further in section 4.4.2.
Also, the size and format of the images attached to framebuffer objectss are con-
trolled entirely within the GL interface, and are not affected by window system
events, such as pixel format selection, window resizes, and display mode changes.
     Additionally, when rendering to or reading from an application created-
framebuffer object,

     jects own all of their pixels.

   • There are no visible color buffer bitplanes. This means there is no color
     buffer corresponding to the back, front, left, or right color bitplanes.

   • The only color buffer bitplanes are the ones defined by the frame-
     buffer attachment points named COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 through COLOR_-
     ATTACHMENTn.

   • The only depth buffer bitplanes are the ones defined by the framebuffer at-
     tachment point DEPTH_ATTACHMENT.

   • The only stencil buffer bitplanes are the ones defined by the framebuffer
     attachment point STENCIL_ATTACHMENT.

   • If the attachment sizes are not all identical, rendering will be limited to the
     largest area that can fit in all of the attachments (an intersection of rectangles
     having a lower left of (0, 0) and an upper right of (width, height) for each
     attachment).

   • If the number of layers of each attachment are not all identical, rendering
     will be limited to the smallest number of layers of any attachment.

   • If the attachment sizes are not all identical, the values of pixels outside the
     common intersection area after rendering are undefined.

   Framebuffer objects are deleted by calling

      void DeleteFramebuffers( sizei n, const
         uint *framebuffers );

framebuffers contains n names of framebuffer objects to be deleted. After a frame-
buffer object is deleted, it has no attachments, and its name is again unused.

If a framebuffer that is currently bound to one or more of the targets DRAW_-
FRAMEBUFFER or READ_FRAMEBUFFER is deleted, it is as though BindFrame-
buffer had been executed with the corresponding target and framebuffer zero. Un-
used names in framebuffers are silently ignored, as is the value zero.
    The command

        void GenFramebuffers( sizei n, uint *ids );

returns n previously unused framebuffer object names in ids. These names are
marked as used, for the purposes of GenFramebuffers only, but they acquire state
and type only when they are first bound.
    The names bound to the draw and read framebuffer bindings can be queried by
calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constants DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING
and READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, respectively. FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is
equivalent to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING.

4.4.2    Attaching Images to Framebuffer Objects
Framebuffer-attachable images may be attached to, and detached from, framebuffer
objects. In contrast, the image attachments of the default framebuffer may not be
changed by the GL.
     A single framebuffer-attachable image may be attached to multiple framebuffer
objects, potentially avoiding some data copies, and possibly decreasing memory
consumption.
     For each logical buffer, a framebuffer object stores a set of state which defines
the logical buffer’s attachment point. The attachment point state contains enough
information to identify the single image attached to the attachment point, or to
indicate that no image is attached. The per-logical buffer attachment point state is
listed in table 6.24
     There are several types of framebuffer-attachable images:

   • The image of a renderbuffer object, which is always two-dimensional.
   • A single level of a one-dimensional texture, which is treated as a two-
     dimensional image with a height of one.
   • A single level of a two-dimensional or rectangle texture.
   • A single face of a cube map texture level, which is treated as a two-
     dimensional image.
   • A single layer of a one-or two-dimensional array texture or three-
     dimensional texture, which is treated as a two-dimensional image.

4.4. FRAMEBUFFER OBJECTS                                                        232


    Additionally, an entire level of a three-dimensional texture, cube map texture,
or one-or two-dimensional array texture can be attached to an attachment point.
Such attachments are treated as an array of two-dimensional images, arranged in
layers, and the corresponding attachment point is considered to be layered (also
see section 4.4.7).

Renderbuffer Objects
A renderbuffer is a data storage object containing a single image of a renderable
internal format. GL provides the methods described below to allocate and delete a
renderbuffer’s image, and to attach a renderbuffer’s image to a framebuffer object.
    The name space for renderbuffer objects is the unsigned integers, with zero
reserved for the GL. A renderbuffer object is created by binding a name returned
by GenRenderbuffers (see below) to RENDERBUFFER. The binding is effected by
calling

      void BindRenderbuffer( enum target, uint renderbuffer );

with target set to RENDERBUFFER and renderbuffer set to the renderbuffer object
name. If renderbuffer is not zero, then the resulting renderbuffer object is a new
state vector, initialized with a zero-sized memory buffer, and comprising the state
values listed in table 6.26. Any previous binding to target is broken.
     BindRenderbuffer may also be used to bind an existing renderbuffer object.
If the bind is successful, no change is made to the state of the newly bound render-
buffer object, and any previous binding to target is broken.
     While a renderbuffer object is bound, GL operations on the target to which it
is bound affect the bound renderbuffer object, and queries of the target to which a
renderbuffer object is bound return state from the bound object.
     The name zero is reserved. A renderbuffer object cannot be created with the
name zero. If renderbuffer is zero, then any previous binding to target is broken
and the target binding is restored to the initial state.
     In the initial state, the reserved name zero is bound to RENDERBUFFER. There is
no renderbuffer object corresponding to the name zero, so client attempts to modify
or query renderbuffer state for the target RENDERBUFFER while zero is bound will
generate GL errors, as described in section 6.1.3.
     The current RENDERBUFFER binding can be determined by calling GetInte-
gerv with the symbolic constant RENDERBUFFER_BINDING.
     BindRenderbuffer fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if
renderbuffer is not zero or a name returned from a previous call to GenRender-
buffers, or if such a name has since been deleted with DeleteRenderbuffers.
     Renderbuffer objects are deleted by calling

4.4. FRAMEBUFFER OBJECTS                                                          233


      void DeleteRenderbuffers( sizei n, const
         uint *renderbuffers );

where renderbuffers contains n names of renderbuffer objects to be deleted. After
a renderbuffer object is deleted, it has no contents, and its name is again unused. If
a renderbuffer that is currently bound to RENDERBUFFER is deleted, it is as though
BindRenderbuffer had been executed with the target RENDERBUFFER and name
of zero. Additionally, special care must be taken when deleting a renderbuffer if
the image of the renderbuffer is attached to a framebuffer object (see section 4.4.2).
Unused names in renderbuffers are silently ignored, as is the value zero.
    The command

      void GenRenderbuffers( sizei n, uint *renderbuffers );

returns n previously unused renderbuffer object names in renderbuffers. These
names are marked as used, for the purposes of GenRenderbuffers only, but they
acquire renderbuffer state only when they are first bound.
    The command

      void RenderbufferStorageMultisample( enum target,
         sizei samples, enum internalformat, sizei width,
         sizei height );

establishes the data storage, format, dimensions, and number of samples of a ren-
derbuffer object’s image. target must be RENDERBUFFER. internalformat must
be color-renderable, depth-renderable, or stencil-renderable (as defined in sec-
tion 4.4.4). width and height are the dimensions in pixels of the renderbuffer. If
either width or height is greater than the value of MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE, or
if samples is greater than the value of MAX_SAMPLES, then the error INVALID_-
VALUE is generated. If internalformat is a signed or unsigned integer format
and samples is greater than the value of MAX_INTEGER_SAMPLES, then the er-
ror INVALID_OPERATION is generated (see “Required Renderbuffer Formats” be-
low). If the GL is unable to create a data store of the requested size, the error
OUT_OF_MEMORY is generated.
     Upon success, RenderbufferStorageMultisample deletes any existing data
store for the renderbuffer image and the contents of the data store after call-
ing RenderbufferStorageMultisample are undefined. RENDERBUFFER_WIDTH
is set to width, RENDERBUFFER_HEIGHT is set to height, and RENDERBUFFER_-
INTERNAL_FORMAT is set to internalformat.
     If samples is zero, then RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES is set to zero. Otherwise
samples represents a request for a desired minimum number of samples. Since

formats that can be used only with renderbuffers.



different implementations may support different sample counts for multisampled
rendering, the actual number of samples allocated for the renderbuffer image is
implementation-dependent. However, the resulting value for RENDERBUFFER_-
SAMPLES is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to samples and no more than the
next larger sample count supported by the implementation.
    A GL implementation may vary its allocation of internal component resolution
based on any RenderbufferStorage parameter (except target), but the allocation
and chosen internal format must not be a function of any other state and cannot be
changed once they are established.
    The command

      void RenderbufferStorage( enum target, enum internalformat,
         sizei width, sizei height );

is equivalent to calling RenderbufferStorageMultisample with samples equal to
zero.

Required Renderbuffer Formats
Implementations are required to support the same internal formats for renderbuffers
as the required formats for textures enumerated in section 3.8.3, with the excep-
tion of the color formats labelled “texture-only”. Requesting one of these internal
formats for a renderbuffer will allocate at least the internal component sizes and
exactly the component types shown for that format in tables 3.12- 3.13.
    Implementations must support creation of renderbuffers in these required for-
mats with up to the value of MAX_SAMPLES multisamples, with the exception
that the signed and unsigned integer formats are required only to support creation
of renderbuffers with up to the value of MAX_INTEGER_SAMPLES multisamples,
which must be at least one.

Attaching Renderbuffer Images to a Framebuffer
A renderbuffer can be attached as one of the logical buffers of the currently bound
framebuffer object by calling

      void FramebufferRenderbuffer( enum target,
         enum attachment, enum renderbuffertarget,
         uint renderbuffer );

target must be DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, READ_FRAMEBUFFER, or FRAMEBUFFER.
FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER. An INVALID_OPERATION
error is generated if the value of the corresponding binding is zero. attachment
should be set to one of the attachment points of the framebuffer listed in table 4.11.
     renderbuffertarget must be RENDERBUFFER and renderbuffer should be set to
the name of the renderbuffer object to be attached to the framebuffer. render-
buffer must be either zero or the name of an existing renderbuffer object of type
renderbuffertarget, otherwise an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated. If ren-
derbuffer is zero, then the value of renderbuffertarget is ignored.
     If renderbuffer is not zero and if FramebufferRenderbuffer is successful,
then the renderbuffer named renderbuffer will be used as the logical buffer iden-
tified by attachment of the framebuffer currently bound to target. The value of
FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE for the specified attachment point is
set to RENDERBUFFER and the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_-
NAME is set to renderbuffer. All other state values of the attachment point specified
by attachment are set to their default values listed in table 6.24. No change is made
to the state of the renderbuffer object and any previous attachment to the attach-
ment logical buffer of the framebuffer object bound to framebuffer target is broken.
If the attachment is not successful, then no change is made to the state of either the
renderbuffer object or the framebuffer object.
     Calling FramebufferRenderbuffer with the renderbuffer name zero will de-
tach the image, if any, identified by attachment, in the framebuffer currently bound
to target. All state values of the attachment point specified by attachment in the
object bound to target are set to their default values listed in table 6.24.
     Setting attachment to the value DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT is a special
case causing both the depth and stencil attachments of the framebuffer object to be
set to renderbuffer, which should have base internal format DEPTH_STENCIL.
     If a renderbuffer object is deleted while its image is attached to one or more
attachment points in the currently bound framebuffer, then it is as if Framebuf-
ferRenderbuffer had been called, with a renderbuffer of 0, for each attachment
point to which this image was attached in the currently bound framebuffer. In
other words, this renderbuffer image is first detached from all attachment points in

the currently bound framebuffer. Note that the renderbuffer image is specifically
not detached from any non-bound framebuffers. Detaching the image from any
non-bound framebuffers is the responsibility of the application.

Attaching Texture Images to a Framebuffer
GL supports copying the rendered contents of the framebuffer into the images of
a texture object through the use of the routines CopyTexImage* and CopyTex-
SubImage*. Additionally, GL supports rendering directly into the images of a
texture object.
    To render directly into a texture image, a specified level of a texture object can
be attached as one of the logical buffers of the currently bound framebuffer object
by calling:

      void FramebufferTexture( enum target, enum attachment,
         uint texture, int level );

   target must be DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, READ_FRAMEBUFFER, or
FRAMEBUFFER. FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER. An
INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if the value of the corresponding binding
is zero. attachment must be one of the attachment points of the framebuffer listed
in table 4.11.
     If texture is non-zero, the specified mipmap level of the texture object named
texture is attached to the framebuffer attachment point named by attachment. An
INVALID_VALUE error is generated if texture is not the name of a texture object, or
if level is not a supported texture level number for textures of the type correspond-
ing to target. An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if texture is the name
of a buffer texture.
     If texture is the name of a three-dimensional texture, cube map texture, one-or
two-dimensional array texture, or two-dimensional multisample array texture, the

texture level attached to the framebuffer attachment point is an array of images,
and the framebuffer attachment is considered layered.
    Additionally, a specified image from a texture object can be attached as one of
the logical buffers of the currently bound framebuffer object by calling one of the
following routines, depending on the type of the texture:
      void FramebufferTexture1D( enum target, enum attachment,
         enum textarget, uint texture, int level );
      void FramebufferTexture2D( enum target, enum attachment,
         enum textarget, uint texture, int level );
      void FramebufferTexture3D( enum target, enum attachment,
         enum textarget, uint texture, int level, int layer );
    In all three routines, target must be DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, READ_-
FRAMEBUFFER, or FRAMEBUFFER. FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to DRAW_-
FRAMEBUFFER. An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if the value of the
corresponding binding is zero. attachment must be one of the attachment points of
the framebuffer listed in table 4.11.
    If texture is not zero, then texture must either name an existing texture
object with an target of textarget, or texture must name an existing cube map
texture and textarget must be one of TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y,                 TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y, or
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z. Otherwise, an INVALID_OPERATION error
is generated.
    level specifies the mipmap level of the texture image to be attached to the
framebuffer.
    If textarget is TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE, or
TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY, then level must be zero. If textarget
is TEXTURE_3D, then level must be greater than or equal to zero and less
than or equal to log2 of the value of MAX_3D_TEXTURE_SIZE. If textarget is
one of TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_-
Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_-
X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y, or TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z,
then level must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to log2 of
the value of MAX_CUBE_MAP_TEXTURE_SIZE. For all other values of textarget,
level must be greater than or equal to zero and no larger than log2 of the value of
MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE. Otherwise, an INVALID_VALUE error is generated.
    layer specifies the layer of a 2-dimensional image within a 3-dimensional tex-
ture. An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if layer is larger than the value of
MAX_3D_TEXTURE_SIZE-1.

    For FramebufferTexture1D, if texture is not zero, then textarget must be
TEXTURE_1D.
   For FramebufferTexture2D, if texture is not zero, then textarget must be one
of TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y,             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_-
X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z, or
TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE.
    For FramebufferTexture3D, if texture is not zero, then textarget must be
TEXTURE_3D.
    The command

      void FramebufferTextureLayer( enum target,
         enum attachment, uint texture, int level, int layer );

operates identically to FramebufferTexture3D, except that it attaches a sin-
gle layer of a three-dimensional, one-or two-dimensional array texture, or two-
dimensional multisample array texture. layer is an integer indicating the layer num-
ber, and is treated identically to the layer parameter in FramebufferTexture3D.
The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if texture is non-zero and layer is nega-
tive. The error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if texture is non-zero and is
not the name of a three dimensional, two-dimensional multisample array, or one-or
two-dimensional array texture. Unlike FramebufferTexture3D, no textarget pa-
rameter is accepted.
    If texture is non-zero and the command does not result in an error, the
framebuffer attachment state corresponding to attachment is updated as in the
other FramebufferTexture commands, except that the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER is set to layer.

Effects of Attaching a Texture Image

     The remaining comments in this section apply to all forms of Framebuffer-
Texture*.
     If texture is zero, any image or array of images attached to the attachment point
named by attachment is detached. Any additional parameters (level, textarget,
and/or layer) are ignored when texture is zero. All state values of the attachment
point specified by attachment are set to their default values listed in table 6.24.
     If texture is not zero, and if FramebufferTexture* is successful, then the spec-
ified texture image will be used as the logical buffer identified by attachment of the
framebuffer currently bound to target. State values of the specified attachment
point are set as follows:

   • The value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is set to
     TEXTURE.

   • The value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME is set to texture.
   • The value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LEVEL is set to level.
   • If FramebufferTexture2D is called and texture is a cube map texture, then
     the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_FACE is
     set to textarget; otherwise it is set to TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X.
   • If FramebufferTextureLayer or FramebufferTexture3D is called, then
     the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER is set to layer;
     otherwise it is set to zero.
   • If FramebufferTexture is called and texture is the name of a three-
     dimensional, cube map, two-dimensional multisample array, or one-or two-
     dimensional array texture, the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_-
     LAYERED is set to TRUE; otherwise it is set to FALSE.

    All other state values of the attachment point specified by attachment are set
to their default values listed in table 6.24. No change is made to the state of the
texture object, and any previous attachment to the attachment logical buffer of the
framebuffer object bound to framebuffer target is broken. If the attachment is not
successful, then no change is made to the state of either the texture object or the
framebuffer object.
    Setting attachment to the value DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT is a special
case causing both the depth and stencil attachments of the framebuffer object to
be set to texture. texture must have base internal format DEPTH_STENCIL, or the
depth and stencil framebuffer attachments will be incomplete (see section 4.4.4).
    If a texture object is deleted while its image is attached to one or more attach-
ment points in the currently bound framebuffer, then it is as if FramebufferTex-
ture* had been called, with a texture of zero, for each attachment point to which
this image was attached in the currently bound framebuffer. In other words, this
texture image is first detached from all attachment points in the currently bound
framebuffer. Note that the texture image is specifically not detached from any
other framebuffer objects. Detaching the texture image from any other framebuffer
objects is the responsibility of the application.

4.4.3   Feedback Loops Between Textures and the Framebuffer
A feedback loop may exist when a texture object is used as both the source and
destination of a GL operation. When a feedback loop exists, undefined behavior

results. This section describes rendering feedback loops (see section 3.8.11) and
texture copying feedback loops (see section 3.8.4) in more detail.

Rendering Feedback Loops
The mechanisms for attaching textures to a framebuffer object do not prevent a
one-or two-dimensional texture level, a face of a cube map texture level, or a layer
of a two-dimensional array or three-dimensional texture from being attached to the
draw framebuffer while the same texture is bound to a texture unit. While this
conditions holds, texturing operations accessing that image will produce undefined
results, as described at the end of section 3.8.11. Conditions resulting in such
undefined behavior are defined in more detail below. Such undefined texturing
operations are likely to leave the final results of fragment processing operations
undefined, and should be avoided.
    Special precautions need to be taken to avoid attaching a texture image to the
currently bound framebuffer while the texture object is currently bound and en-
abled for texturing. Doing so could lead to the creation of a rendering feedback
loop between the writing of pixels by GL rendering operations and the simulta-
neous reading of those same pixels when used as texels in the currently bound
texture. In this scenario, the framebuffer will be considered framebuffer complete
(see section 4.4.4), but the values of fragments rendered while in this state will be
undefined. The values of texture samples may be undefined as well, as described
under “Rendering Feedback Loops” in section 3.8.11
    Specifically, the values of rendered fragments are undefined if all of the fol-
lowing conditions are true:

   • an image from texture object T is attached to the currently bound draw frame-
     buffer at attachment point A

   • the texture object T is currently bound to a texture unit U, and

   • the current programmable vertex and/or fragment processing state makes it
     possible (see below) to sample from the texture object T bound to texture
     unit U

while either of the following conditions are true:

   • the value of TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER for texture object T is NEAREST or
     LINEAR, and the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LEVEL
     for attachment point A is equal to the value of TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL for
     the texture object T

   • the value of TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER for texture object T is one
     of NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST, NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR, LINEAR_-

     within the the range specified by the current values of TEXTURE_BASE_-
     LEVEL to q, inclusive, for the texture object T. (q is defined in the Mipmap-
     ping discussion of section 3.8.11).

    For the purpose of this discussion, it is possible to sample from the texture
object T bound to texture unit U if the active fragment or vertex shader contains
any instructions that might sample from the texture object T bound to U, even if
those instructions might only be executed conditionally.
    Note that if TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL and TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL exclude any
levels containing image(s) attached to the currently bound framebuffer, then the
above conditions will not be met (i.e., the above rule will not cause the values of
rendered fragments to be undefined.)

Texture Copying Feedback Loops
Similarly to rendering feedback loops, it is possible for a texture image to be
attached to the read framebuffer while the same texture image is the destination
of a CopyTexImage* operation, as described under “Texture Copying Feedback
Loops” in section 3.8.4. While this condition holds, a texture copying feedback
loop between the writing of texels by the copying operation and the reading of
those same texels when used as pixels in the read framebuffer may exist. In this
scenario, the values of texels written by the copying operation will be undefined
(in the same fashion that overlapping copies via BlitFramebuffer are undefined).
     Specifically, the values of copied texels are undefined if all of the following
conditions are true:

   • an image from texture object T is attached to the currently bound read frame-
     buffer at attachment point A

   • the selected read buffer is attachment point A

   • T is bound to the texture target of a CopyTexImage* operation

   • the level argument of the copying operation selects the same image that is
     attached to A

4.4.4   Framebuffer Completeness
A framebuffer must be framebuffer complete to effectively be used as the draw or
read framebuffer of the GL.
    The default framebuffer is always complete if it exists; however, if no default
framebuffer exists (no window system-provided drawable is associated with the
GL context), it is deemed to be incomplete.
    A framebuffer object is said to be framebuffer complete if all of its attached
images, and all framebuffer parameters required to utilize the framebuffer for ren-
dering and reading, are consistently defined and meet the requirements defined
below. The rules of framebuffer completeness are dependent on the properties of
the attached images, and on certain implementation-dependent restrictions.
    The internal formats of the attached images can affect the completeness of
the framebuffer, so it is useful to first define the relationship between the internal
format of an image and the attachment points to which it can be attached.

   • The following base internal formats from table 3.11 are color-renderable:
     RED, RG, RGB, and RGBA. The sized internal formats from table 3.12 that
     have a color-renderable base internal format are also color-renderable. No
     other formats, including compressed internal formats, are color-renderable.

   • An internal format is depth-renderable if it is DEPTH_COMPONENT or one
     of the formats from table 3.13 whose base internal format is DEPTH_-
     COMPONENT or DEPTH_STENCIL. No other formats are depth-renderable.

   • An internal format is stencil-renderable if it is STENCIL_INDEX or
     DEPTH_STENCIL, if it is one of the STENCIL_INDEX formats from ta-
     ble 4.10, or if it is one of the formats from table 3.13 whose base internal
     format is DEPTH_STENCIL. No other formats are stencil-renderable.

Framebuffer Attachment Completeness
If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE for the framebuffer
attachment point attachment is not NONE, then it is said that a framebuffer-
attachable image, named image, is attached to the framebuffer at the attachment
point. image is identified by the state in attachment as described in section 4.4.2.
     The framebuffer attachment point attachment is said to be framebuffer attach-
ment complete if the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE for
attachment is NONE (i.e., no image is attached), or if all of the following conditions
are true:

   • image is a component of an existing object with the name specified by
     the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME, and of the type
     specified by the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE.

   • The width and height of image are non-zero.

   • If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is TEXTURE
     and the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME names
     a three-dimensional texture, then the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
     ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER must be smaller than the depth of the
     texture.

   • If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is TEXTURE
     and the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME names a
     one-or two-dimensional array texture, then the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
     ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER must be smaller than the number of layers
     in the texture.

   • If attachment is COLOR_ATTACHMENTi, then image must have a color-
     renderable internal format.

   • If attachment is DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, then image must have a depth-
     renderable internal format.

   • If attachment is STENCIL_ATTACHMENT, then image must have a stencil-
     renderable internal format.

Whole Framebuffer Completeness
Each rule below is followed by an error token enclosed in { brackets }. The mean-
ing of these errors is explained below and under “Effects of Framebuffer Com-
pleteness on Framebuffer Operations” later in section 4.4.4.
    The framebuffer object target is said to be framebuffer complete if all the fol-
lowing conditions are true:

   • target is the default framebuffer, and the default framebuffer exists.

      { FRAMEBUFFER_UNDEFINED }

   • All framebuffer attachment points are framebuffer attachment complete.

  • There is at least one image attached to the framebuffer.

    { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MISSING_ATTACHMENT }

  • The value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE must not be
    NONE for any color attachment point(s) named by DRAW_BUFFERi.

    { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DRAW_BUFFER }

  • If READ_BUFFER is not NONE, then the value of FRAMEBUFFER_-
    ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE must not be NONE for the color attachment

    { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_READ_BUFFER }

  • The combination of internal formats of the attached images does not violate
    an implementation-dependent set of restrictions.

    { FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED }

  • The value of RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES is the same for all attached render-
    buffers; the value of TEXTURE_SAMPLES is the same for all attached tex-
    tures; and, if the attached images are a mix of renderbuffers and textures,
    the value of RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES matches the value of TEXTURE_-
    SAMPLES.

    { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MULTISAMPLE }

  • The value of TEXTURE_FIXED_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS is the same for all

    and textures, the value of TEXTURE_FIXED_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS must be
    TRUE for all attached textures.

    { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MULTISAMPLE }

  • If any framebuffer attachment is layered, all populated attachments must be
    layered. Additionally, all populated color attachments must be from textures
    of the same target.

    The token in brackets after each clause of the framebuffer completeness rules
specifies the return value of CheckFramebufferStatus (see below) that is gen-
erated when that clause is violated. If more than one clause is violated, it is
implementation-dependent which value will be returned by CheckFramebuffer-
Status.
    Performing any of the following actions may change whether the framebuffer
is considered complete or incomplete:

   • Binding to a different framebuffer with BindFramebuffer.

   • Attaching an image to the framebuffer with FramebufferTexture* or
     FramebufferRenderbuffer.

   • Detaching an image from the framebuffer with FramebufferTexture* or
     FramebufferRenderbuffer.

   • Changing the internal format of a texture image that is attached to the frame-
     buffer by calling CopyTexImage* or CompressedTexImage*.

   • Changing the internal format of a renderbuffer that is attached to the frame-
     buffer by calling RenderbufferStorage.

   • Deleting, with DeleteTextures or DeleteRenderbuffers, an object contain-
     ing an image that is attached to a framebuffer object that is bound to the
     framebuffer.

   • Changing the read buffer or one of the draw buffers.

   • Associating a different window system-provided drawable, or no drawable,
     with the default framebuffer using a window system binding API such as
     those described in section 1.7.2.

    Although the GL defines a wide variety of internal formats for framebuffer-
attachable images, such as texture images and renderbuffer images, some imple-
mentations may not support rendering to particular combinations of internal for-
mats. If the combination of formats of the images attached to a framebuffer object
are not supported by the implementation, then the framebuffer is not complete un-
der the clause labeled FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED.
    Implementations are required to support certain combinations of framebuffer
internal formats as described under “Required Framebuffer Formats” in sec-
tion 4.4.4.
    Because of the implementation-dependent clause of the framebuffer complete-
ness test in particular, and because framebuffer completeness can change when the

set of attached images is modified, it is strongly advised, though not required, that
an application check to see if the framebuffer is complete prior to rendering. The
status of the framebuffer object currently bound to target can be queried by calling

      enum CheckFramebufferStatus( enum target );

   target must be DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, READ_FRAMEBUFFER,                             or
FRAMEBUFFER. FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.                       If
CheckFramebufferStatus generates an error, zero is returned.
    Otherwise, a value is returned that identifies whether or not the framebuffer
bound to target is complete, and if not complete the value identifies one of the
rules of framebuffer completeness that is violated. If the framebuffer is complete,
then FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE is returned.
    The values of SAMPLE_BUFFERS and SAMPLES are derived from the at-
tachments of the currently bound framebuffer object. If the current DRAW_-
FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is not framebuffer complete, then both SAMPLE_-
BUFFERS and SAMPLES are undefined. Otherwise, SAMPLES is equal to the value
of RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES for the attached images (which all must have the
same value for RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES). Further, SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one if
SAMPLES is non-zero. Otherwise, SAMPLE_BUFFERS is zero.

Required Framebuffer Formats
Implementations must support framebuffer objects with up to MAX_COLOR_-
ATTACHMENTS color attachments, a depth attachment, and a stencil attachment.
Each color attachment may be in any of the required color formats for textures
and renderbuffers described in sections 3.8.3 and 4.4.2. The depth attachment may
be in any of the required depth or combined depth+stencil formats described in
those sections, and the stencil attachment may be in any of the required combined
depth+stencil formats. However, when both depth and stencil attachments are
present, implementations are only required to support framebuffer objects where
both attachments refer to the same image.
    There must be at least one default framebuffer format allowing creation of a
default framebuffer supporting front-buffered rendering.

Effects of Framebuffer Completeness on Framebuffer Operations
Attempting to render to or read from a framebuffer which is not framebuffer com-
plete will generate an INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION error. This means
that rendering commands such as DrawArrays or one of the other drawing com-
mands defined in section 2.8.3, as well as commands that read the framebuffer

4.4. FRAMEBUFFER OBJECTS                                                        247


such as ReadPixels, CopyTexImage, and CopyTexSubImage, will generate the
error INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION if called while the framebuffer is not
framebuffer complete. This error is generated regardless of whether fragments are
actually read from or written to the framebuffer. For example, it will be generated
when a rendering command is called and the framebuffer is incomplete even if
RASTERIZER_DISCARD is enabled.


4.4.5   Effects of Framebuffer State on Framebuffer Dependent Values
The values of the state variables listed in table 6.48 may change when a change
is made to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, to the state of the currently bound
framebuffer object, or to an image attached to the currently bound framebuffer
object.
     When DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is zero, the values of the state variables
listed in table 6.48 are implementation defined.
     When DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero, if the currently bound
framebuffer object is not framebuffer complete, then the values of the state vari-
ables listed in table 6.48 are undefined.
     When DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero and the currently bound
framebuffer object is framebuffer complete, then the values of the state variables
listed in table 6.48 are completely determined by DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING,
the state of the currently bound framebuffer object, and the state of the images at-
tached to the currently bound framebuffer object. The actual sizes of the color,
depth, or stencil bit planes can be obtained by querying an attachment point us-
ing GetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv, or querying the object attached to
that point. If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE at a par-
ticular attachment point is RENDERBUFFER, the sizes may be determined by call-
ing GetRenderbufferParameteriv as described in section 6.1.3. If the value of
FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE at a particular attachment point is
TEXTURE, the sizes may be determined by calling GetTexParameter, as described
in section 6.1.3.

4.4.6   Mapping between Pixel and Element in Attached Image
When DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING is non-zero, an operation that writes to the
framebuffer modifies the image attached to the selected logical buffer, and an oper-
ation that reads from the framebuffer reads from the image attached to the selected
logical buffer.
    If the attached image is a renderbuffer image, then the window coordinates
(xw , yw ) corresponds to the value in the renderbuffer image at the same coordi-

nates.
    If the attached image is a texture image, then the window coordinates (xw , yw )
correspond to the texel (i, j, k) from figure 3.6 as follows:

                                     i = (xw − b)

                                     j = (yw − b)
                                   k = (layer − b)
where b is the texture image’s border width and layer is the value of
FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER for the selected logical buffer.
For a two-dimensional texture, k and layer are irrelevant; for a one-dimensional
texture, j, k, and layer are irrelevant.
    (xw , yw ) corresponds to a border texel if xw , yw , or layer is less than the border
width, or if xw , yw , or layer is greater than or equal to the border width plus the
width, height, or depth, respectively, of the texture image.

Conversion to Framebuffer-Attachable Image Components
When an enabled color value is written to the framebuffer while the draw frame-
buffer binding is non-zero, for each draw buffer the R, G, B, and A values are
converted to internal components as described in table 3.11, according to the ta-
ble row corresponding to the internal format of the framebuffer-attachable image
attached to the selected logical buffer, and the resulting internal components are
written to the image attached to logical buffer. The masking operations described
in section 4.2.2 are also effective.

Conversion to RGBA Values
When a color value is read or is used as the source of a logical operation or blending
while the read framebuffer binding is non-zero, the components of the framebuffer-
attachable image that is attached to the logical buffer selected by READ_BUFFER
are first converted to R, G, B, and A values according to table 3.20 and the internal
format of the attached image.

4.4.7   Layered Framebuffers
A framebuffer is considered to be layered if it is complete and all of its populated
attachments are layered. When rendering to a layered framebuffer, each fragment
generated by the GL is assigned a layer number. The layer number for a fragment
is zero if

   • geometry shaders are disabled, or

   • the current geometry shader does not statically assign a value to the built-in
     output variable gl_Layer.

    Otherwise, the layer for each point, line, or triangle emitted by the geometry
shader is taken from the gl_Layer output of one of the vertices of the primitive.
The vertex used is implementation-dependent. To get defined results, all vertices
of each primitive emitted should set the same value for gl_Layer. Since the
EndPrimitive built-in function starts a new output primitive, defined results can
be achieved if EndPrimitive is called between two vertices emitted with differ-
ent layer numbers. A layer number written by a geometry shader has no effect if
the framebuffer is not layered.
    When fragments are written to a layered framebuffer, the fragment’s layer num-
ber selects an image from the array of images at each attachment point to use for
the stencil test (see section 4.1.4), depth buffer test (see section 4.1.5), and for
blending and color buffer writes (see section 4.1.7). If the fragment’s layer number
is negative, or greater than the minimum number of layers of any attachment, the
effects of the fragment on the framebuffer contents are undefined.
    When the Clear or ClearBuffer* commands are used to clear a layered frame-
buffer attachment, all layers of the attachment are cleared.
    When commands such as ReadPixels read from a layered framebuffer, the
image at layer zero of the selected attachment is always used to obtain pixel values.
    When cube map texture levels are attached to a layered framebuffer, there are
six layers, numbered zero through five. Each layer number corresponds to a cube
map face, as shown in table 4.12.

Chapter 5

Special Functions

This chapter describes additional GL functionality that does not fit easily into any
of the preceding chapters. This functionality consists of flushing and finishing
(used to synchronize the GL command stream), and hints.


5.1    Timer Queries
Timer queries use query objects to track the amount of time needed to fully com-
plete a set of GL commands, or to determine the current time of the GL.
    When BeginQuery and EndQuery are called with a target of TIME_ELAPSED,
the GL prepares to start and stop the timer used for timer queries. The timer is
started or stopped when the effects from all previous commands on the GL client
and server state and the framebuffer have been fully realized. The BeginQuery and
EndQuery commands may return before the timer is actually started or stopped.
When the timer query timer is finally stopped, the elapsed time (in nanoseconds) is
written to the corresponding query object as the query result value, and the query
result for that object is marked as available.
    If the elapsed time overflows the number of bits, n, available to hold elapsed
time, its value becomes undefined. It is recommended, but not required, that im-
plementations handle this overflow case by saturating at 2n − 1.
    When the command

      void QueryCounter( uint id, enum target );

is called with target TIMESTAMP, the GL records the current time into the corre-
sponding query object. The time is recorded after all previous commands on the GL
client and server state and the framebuffer have been fully realized. When the time
is recorded, the query result for that object is marked available. QueryCounter

                                        250
5.2. FLUSH AND FINISH                                                            251


timer queries can be used within a BeginQuery / EndQuery block where the tar-
get is TIME_ELAPSED and it does not affect the result of that query object. The
error INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id is already in use within a Begin-
Query / EndQuery block.
    The current time of the GL may be queried by calling GetIntegerv or Get-
Integer64v with the symbolic constant TIMESTAMP. This will return the GL time
after all previous commands have reached the GL server but have not yet neces-
sarily executed. By using a combination of this synchronous get command and the
asynchronous timestamp query object target, applications can measure the latency
between when commands reach the GL server and when they are realized in the
framebuffer.


5.2    Flush and Finish
The command

      void Flush( void );

indicates that all commands that have previously been sent to the GL must complete
in finite time.
     The command

      void Finish( void );

forces all previous GL commands to complete. Finish does not return until all
effects from previously issued commands on GL client and server state and the
framebuffer are fully realized.


5.3    Sync Objects and Fences
Sync objects act as a synchronization primitive - a representation of events whose
completion status can be tested or waited upon. Sync objects may be used for syn-
chronization with operations occuring in the GL state machine or in the graphics
pipeline, and for synchronizing between multiple graphics contexts, among other
purposes.
    Sync objects have a status value with two possible states: signaled and
unsignaled. Events are associated with a sync object. When a sync object is cre-
ated, its status is set to unsignaled. When the associated event occurs, the sync
object is signaled (its status is set to signaled). The GL may be asked to wait for a
sync object to become signaled.

         Table 5.1: Initial properties of a sync object created with FenceSync.


   Initially, only one specific type of sync object is defined: the fence sync object,
whose associated event is triggered by a fence command placed in the GL com-
mand stream. Fence sync objects are used to wait for partial completion of the GL
command stream, as a more flexible form of Finish.
   The command

         sync FenceSync( enum condition, bitfield flags );

creates a new fence sync object, inserts a fence command in the GL command
stream and associates it with that sync object, and returns a non-zero name corre-
sponding to the sync object.
    When the specified condition of the sync object is satisfied by the fence com-
mand, the sync object is signaled by the GL, causing any ClientWaitSync or Wait-
Sync commands (see below) blocking on sync to unblock. No other state is affected
by FenceSync or by execution of the associated fence command.
    condition must be SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE. This condition is satis-
fied by completion of the fence command corresponding to the sync object and all
preceding commands in the same command stream. The sync object will not be
signaled until all effects from these commands on GL client and server state and the
framebuffer are fully realized. Note that completion of the fence command occurs
once the state of the corresponding sync object has been changed, but commands
waiting on that sync object may not be unblocked until after the fence command
completes.
    flags must be 01 .
    Each sync object contains a number of properties which determine the state of
the object and the behavior of any commands associated with it. Each property has
a property name and property value. The initial property values for a sync object
created by FenceSync are shown in table 5.1.

The SYNC_STATUS property will be changed to SIGNALED when condition is sat-
isfied.
     If FenceSync fails to create a sync object, zero will be returned and a GL error
will be generated as described. An INVALID_ENUM error is generated if condition
is not SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE. If flags is not zero, an INVALID_VALUE
error is generated
     A sync object can be deleted by passing its name to the command
        void DeleteSync( sync sync );
    If the fence command corresponding to the specified sync object has com-
pleted, or if no ClientWaitSync or WaitSync commands are blocking on sync, the
object is deleted immediately. Otherwise, sync is flagged for deletion and will be
deleted when it is no longer associated with any fence command and is no longer
blocking any ClientWaitSync or WaitSync command. In either case, after return-
ing from DeleteSync the sync name is invalid and can no longer be used to refer to
the sync object.
    DeleteSync will silently ignore a sync value of zero. An INVALID_VALUE
error is generated if sync is neither zero nor the name of a sync object.

5.3.1    Waiting for Sync Objects
The command
        enum ClientWaitSync( sync sync, bitfield flags,
           uint64 timeout );
causes the GL to block, and will not return until the sync object sync is signaled,
or until the specified timeout period expires. timeout is in units of nanoseconds.
timeout is adjusted to the closest value allowed by the implementation-dependent
timeout accuracy, which may be substantially longer than one nanosecond, and
may be longer than the requested period.
    If sync is signaled at the time ClientWaitSync is called, then ClientWait-
Sync returns immediately. If sync is unsignaled at the time ClientWaitSync is
called, then ClientWaitSync will block and will wait up to timeout nanoseconds
for sync to become signaled. flags controls command flushing behavior, and may
be SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT, as discussed in section 5.3.2.
    ClientWaitSync returns one of four status values. A return value of
ALREADY_SIGNALED indicates that sync was signaled at the time ClientWait-
Sync was called. ALREADY_SIGNALED will always be returned if sync was sig-
naled, even if the value of timeout is zero. A return value of TIMEOUT_EXPIRED

indicates that the specified timeout period expired before sync was signaled. A re-
turn value of CONDITION_SATISFIED indicates that sync was signaled before the
timeout expired. Finally, if an error occurs, in addition to generating a GL error
as specified below, ClientWaitSync immediately returns WAIT_FAILED without
blocking.
    If the value of timeout is zero, then ClientWaitSync does not block, but simply
tests the current state of sync. TIMEOUT_EXPIRED will be returned in this case if
sync is not signaled, even though no actual wait was performed.
    If sync is not the name of a sync object, an INVALID_VALUE error is gen-
erated. If flags contains any bits other than SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT, an
INVALID_VALUE error is generated.
    The command

       void WaitSync( sync sync, bitfield flags,
          uint64 timeout );

is similar to ClientWaitSync, but instead of blocking and not returning to the ap-
plication until sync is signaled, WaitSync returns immediately, instead causing the
GL server to block 2 until sync is signaled 3 .
     sync has the same meaning as for ClientWaitSync.
     timeout must currently be the special value TIMEOUT_IGNORED, and is not
used. Instead, WaitSync will always wait no longer than an implementation-
dependent timeout. The duration of this timeout in nanoseconds may be queried
by calling GetInteger64v with the symbolic constant MAX_SERVER_WAIT_-
TIMEOUT. There is currently no way to determine whether WaitSync unblocked
because the timeout expired or because the sync object being waited on was sig-
naled.
     flags must be 0.
     If an error occurs, WaitSync generates a GL error as specified below, and does
not cause the GL server to block.
     If sync is not the name of a sync object, an INVALID_VALUE error is generated.
If timeout is not TIMEOUT_IGNORED or flags is not zero, an INVALID_VALUE error
is generated4 .
   2
      The GL server may choose to wait either in the CPU executing server-side code, or in the GPU
hardware if it supports this operation.
    3
      WaitSync allows applications to continue to queue commands from the client in anticipation of
the sync being signalled, increasing client-server parallelism.
    4
      flags and timeout are placeholders for anticipated future extensions of sync object capabilities.
They must have these reserved values in order that existing code calling WaitSync operate properly
in the presence of such extensions.

Multiple Waiters
It is possible for both the GL client to be blocked on a sync object in a ClientWait-
Sync command, the GL server to be blocked as the result of a previous WaitSync
command, and for additional WaitSync commands to be queued in the GL server,
all for a single sync object. When such a sync object is signaled in this situation,
the client will be unblocked, the server will be unblocked, and all such queued
WaitSync commands will continue immediately when they are reached.
     See appendix D.2 for more information about blocking on a sync object in
multiple GL contexts.

5.3.2    Signalling
A fence sync object enters the signaled state only once the corresponding fence
command has completed and signaled the sync object.
     If the sync object being blocked upon will not be signaled in finite time (for
example, by an associated fence command issued previously, but not yet flushed
to the graphics pipeline), then ClientWaitSync may hang forever. To help prevent
this behavior 5 , if the SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT bit is set in flags, and sync
is unsignaled when ClientWaitSync is called, then the equivalent of Flush will be
performed before blocking on sync.
     If a sync object is marked for deletion while a client is blocking on that object
in a ClientWaitSync command, or a GL server is blocking on that object as a result
of a prior WaitSync command, deletion is deferred until the sync object is signaled
and all blocked GL clients and servers are unblocked.
     Additional constraints on the use of sync objects are discussed in appendix D.
     State must be maintained to indicate which sync object names are currently in
use. The state require for each sync object in use is an integer for the specific type,
an integer for the condition, and a bit indicating whether the object is signaled
or unsignaled. The initial values of sync object state are defined as specified by
FenceSync.
   5
     The simple flushing behavior defined by SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT will not help
when waiting for a fence command issued in another context’s command stream to complete. Ap-
plications which block on a fence sync object must take additional steps to assure that the context
from which the corresponding fence command was issued has flushed that command to the graphics
pipeline.

5.4    Hints
Certain aspects of GL behavior, when there is room for variation, may be controlled
with hints. A hint is specified using

      void Hint( enum target, enum hint );

target is a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be controlled, and hint is a
symbolic constant indicating what type of behavior is desired. The possible targets
are described in table 5.2; for each target, hint must be one of FASTEST, indicating
that the most efficient option should be chosen; NICEST, indicating that the highest
quality option should be chosen; and DONT_CARE, indicating no preference in the
matter.
    For the texture compression hint, a hint of FASTEST indicates that texture im-
ages should be compressed as quickly as possible, while NICEST indicates that
the texture images be compressed with as little image degradation as possible.
FASTEST should be used for one-time texture compression, and NICEST should
be used if the compression results are to be retrieved by GetCompressedTexIm-
age (section 6.1.4) for reuse.
    The interpretation of hints is implementation-dependent. An implementation
may ignore them entirely.
    The initial value of all hints is DONT_CARE.

Chapter 6

State and State Requests

The state required to describe the GL machine is enumerated in section 6.2. Most
state is set through the calls described in previous chapters, and can be queried
using the calls described in section 6.1.


6.1     Querying GL State
6.1.1    Simple Queries
Much of the GL state is completely identified by symbolic constants. The values
of these state variables can be obtained using a set of Get commands. There are
four commands for obtaining simple state variables:

        void   GetBooleanv( enum pname, boolean *data );
        void   GetIntegerv( enum pname, int *data );
        void   GetInteger64v( enum pname, int64 *data );
        void   GetFloatv( enum pname, float *data );
        void   GetDoublev( enum pname, double *data );

The commands obtain boolean, integer, 64-bit integer, floating-point, or double-
precision state variables. pname is a symbolic constant indicating the state variable
to return. data is a pointer to a scalar or array of the indicated type in which to place
the returned data.
     Indexed simple state variables are queried with the commands

        void GetBooleani v( enum target, uint index,
           boolean *data );
        void GetIntegeri v( enum target, uint index, int *data );


                                          257
6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                             258


           void GetInteger64i v( enum target, uint index,
           int64 *data );

target is the name of the indexed state and index is the index of the particular
element being queried. data is a pointer to a scalar or array of the indicated type in
which to place the returned data. An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index
is outside the valid range for the indexed state target.
    Finally,

        boolean IsEnabled( enum cap );

can be used to determine if cap is currently enabled (as with Enable) or disabled,
and

        boolean IsEnabledi( enum target, uint index );

can be used to determine if the indexed state corresponding to target and index is
enabled or disabled. An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index is outside the
valid range for the indexed state target.

6.1.2    Data Conversions
If a Get command is issued that returns value types different from the type of the
value being obtained, a type conversion is performed. If GetBooleanv is called, a
floating-point or integer value converts to FALSE if and only if it is zero (otherwise
it converts to TRUE). If any of the other simple queries are called, a boolean value
of TRUE or FALSE is interpreted as 1 or 0, respectively. If GetIntegerv or GetInte-
ger64v are called, a floating-point value is rounded to the nearest integer, unless
the value is an RGBA color component, a DepthRange value, or a depth buffer
clear value. In these cases, the Get command converts the floating-point value to
an integer according to the INT entry of table 4.9; a value not in [−1, 1] converts
to an undefined value. If GetFloatv is called, a boolean value of TRUE or FALSE is
interpreted as 1.0 or 0.0, respectively, an integer is coerced to floating-point, and a
double-precision floating-point value is converted to single-precision. Analogous
conversions are carried out in the case of GetDoublev. If a value is so large in
magnitude that it cannot be represented with the requested type, then the nearest
value representable using the requested type is returned.
     Unless otherwise indicated, multi-valued state variables return their multiple
values in the same order as they are given as arguments to the commands that set
them. For instance, the two DepthRange parameters are returned in the order n
followed by f.

6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                             259


     If fragment color clamping is enabled, querying of the texture border color,
blend color, and RGBA clear color will clamp the corresponding state values to
[0, 1] before returning them. This behavior provides compatibility with previous
versions of the GL that clamped these values when specified.
     Most texture state variables are qualified by the value of ACTIVE_TEXTURE to
determine which server texture state vector is queried. Table 6.13 indicates those
state variables which are qualified by ACTIVE_TEXTURE during state queries.
     Vertex array state variables are qualified by the value of VERTEX_ARRAY_-
BINDING to determine which vertex array object is queried. Tables 6.4 and 6.5
define the set of state stored in a vertex array object.

6.1.3    Enumerated Queries
Other commands exist to obtain state variables that are identified by a category as
well as a symbolic constant.
   The commands

        void GetTexParameter{if}v( enum target, enum value,
           T data );
        void GetTexParameterI{i ui}v( enum target, enum value,
           T data );

place information about texture parameter value for the specified target into data.
value must be one of the symbolic values in table 3.16.
    target may be one of TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_3D, TEXTURE_-
1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or TEXTURE_CUBE_-
MAP, indicating the currently bound one-, two-, three-dimensional, one- or two-
dimensional array, rectangular, or cube map texture object.
    Querying value TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR with GetTexParameterIiv or Get-
TexParameterIuiv returns the border color values as signed integers or unsigned
integers, respectively; otherwise the values are returned as described in sec-
tion 6.1.2. If the border color is queried with a type that does not match the original
type with which it was specified, the result is undefined.

        void GetTexLevelParameter{if}v( enum target, int lod,
           enum value, T data );

places information about texture image parameter value for level-of-detail lod of
the specified target into data. value must be one of the symbolic values in ta-
ble 6.16.

MAP_POSITIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X, TEXTURE_CUBE_-

TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, PROXY_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE, or PROXY_-
TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY, indicating the one-, two-, or three-
dimensional texture, one-or two-dimensional array texture, rectangular texture,
one of the six distinct 2D images making up the cube map texture object,
two-dimensional multisample texture, two-dimensional multisample array texture;
or the one-, two-, three-dimensional, one-or two-dimensional array, rectangular,
cube map, two-dimensional multisample, or two-dimensional multisample array
proxy state vector.
    target may also be TEXTURE_BUFFER, indicating the texture buffer. In the case
lod must be zero or an INVALID_VALUE error is generated.
    Note that TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP is not a valid target parameter for Get-
TexLevelParameter, because it does not specify a particular cube map face.
    lod determines which level-of-detail’s state is returned. If lod is less than zero
or larger than the maximum allowable level-of-detail, then an INVALID_VALUE
error is generated.
    For texture images with uncompressed internal formats, queries of
value TEXTURE_RED_TYPE, TEXTURE_GREEN_TYPE, TEXTURE_BLUE_TYPE,
TEXTURE_ALPHA_TYPE, and TEXTURE_DEPTH_TYPE return the data type used
to store the component. Types NONE, SIGNED_NORMALIZED, UNSIGNED_-
NORMALIZED, FLOAT, INT, and UNSIGNED_INT respectively indicate missing,
signed normalized fixed-point, unsigned normalized fixed-point, floating-point,
signed unnormalized integer, and unsigned unnormalized integer components.
Queries of value TEXTURE_RED_SIZE, TEXTURE_GREEN_SIZE, TEXTURE_-
BLUE_SIZE, TEXTURE_ALPHA_SIZE, TEXTURE_DEPTH_SIZE, TEXTURE_-
STENCIL_SIZE, and TEXTURE_SHARED_SIZE return the actual resolutions of the
stored image array components, not the resolutions specified when the image array
was defined.
    For texture images with compressed internal formats, the types returned spec-
ify how components are interpreted after decompression, while the resolutions re-
turned specify the component resolution of an uncompressed internal format that
produces an image of roughly the same quality as the compressed image in ques-
tion. Since the quality of the implementation’s compression algorithm is likely

data-dependent, the returned component sizes should be treated only as rough ap-
proximations.
    Querying value TEXTURE_COMPRESSED_IMAGE_SIZE returns the size (in
ubytes) of the compressed texture image that would be returned by GetCom-
pressedTexImage (section 6.1.4). Querying TEXTURE_COMPRESSED_IMAGE_-
SIZE is not allowed on texture images with an uncompressed internal format or on
proxy targets and will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error if attempted.
    Queries of value TEXTURE_WIDTH, TEXTURE_HEIGHT, and TEXTURE_DEPTH
return the width, height, and depth as specified when the image array was cre-
ated. The internal format of the image array is queried as TEXTURE_INTERNAL_-
FORMAT.

6.1.4    Texture Queries
The command

        void GetTexImage( enum tex, int lod, enum format,
           enum type, void *img );

is used to obtain texture images. It is somewhat different from the other Get* com-
mands; tex is a symbolic value indicating which texture (or texture face in the case
of a cube map texture target name) is to be obtained. TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_-
2D, TEXTURE_3D, TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, and TEXTURE_-
RECTANGLE indicate a one-, two-, or three-dimensional, one- or two-dimensional
array, or rectangular texture respectively. TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X,                  TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y,
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y, TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z, and
TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z indicate the respective face of a cube map
texture. lod is a level-of-detail number, format is a pixel format from table 3.3,
type is a pixel type from table 3.2.
    Any of the following mismatches between format and the internal format of
the texture image will generate an INVALID_OPERATION error:

   • format is a color format (one of the formats in table 3.3 whose target is the
     color buffer) and the base internal format of the texture image is not a color
     format.
   • format is DEPTH_COMPONENT and the base internal format is not DEPTH_-
     COMPONENT or DEPTH_STENCIL.

   • format is DEPTH_STENCIL and the base internal format is not DEPTH_-
     STENCIL.

   • format is one of the integer formats in table 3.3 and the internal format of
     the texture image is not integer, or format is not one of the integer formats in
     table 3.3 and the internal format is integer.

     GetTexImage obtains component groups from a texture image with the indi-
cated level-of-detail. If format is a color format then the components are assigned
among R, G, B, and A according to table 6.1, starting with the first group in the
first row, and continuing by obtaining groups in order from each row and proceed-
ing from the first row to the last, and from the first image to the last for three-
dimensional textures. One- and two-dimensional array textures are treated as two-
and three-dimensional images, respectively, where the layers are treated as rows or
images. If format is DEPTH_COMPONENT, then each depth component is assigned
with the same ordering of rows and images. If format is DEPTH_STENCIL, then
each depth component and each stencil index is assigned with the same ordering
of rows and images.
     These groups are then packed and placed in client or pixel buffer object mem-
ory. If a pixel pack buffer is bound (as indicated by a non-zero value of PIXEL_-
PACK_BUFFER_BINDING), img is an offset into the pixel pack buffer; otherwise,
img is a pointer to client memory. Pixel storage modes that are applicable to
ReadPixels are applied.
     For three-dimensional and two-dimensional array textures, pixel storage op-
erations are applied as if the image were two-dimensional, except that the addi-
tional pixel storage state values PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT and PACK_SKIP_IMAGES
are applied. The correspondence of texels to memory locations is as defined for
TexImage3D in section 3.8.3.
     The row length, number of rows, image depth, and number of images are de-
termined by the size of the texture image (including any borders). Calling GetTex-
Image with lod less than zero or larger than the maximum allowable causes the
error INVALID_VALUE. Calling GetTexImage with a format of STENCIL_INDEX
causes the error INVALID_ENUM. Calling GetTexImage with a non-zero lod when
tex is TEXTURE_RECTANGLE causes the error INVALID_VALUE. If a pixel pack
buffer object is bound and packing the texture image into the buffer’s memory
would exceed the size of the buffer, an INVALID_OPERATION error results. If a
pixel pack buffer object is bound and img is not evenly divisible by the number of
basic machine units needed to store in memory the GL data type corresponding to
type (see table 3.2), an INVALID_OPERATION error results.

value is used.

is used to obtain texture images stored in compressed form. The parameters tar-
get, lod, and img are interpreted in the same manner as in GetTexImage. When
called, GetCompressedTexImage writes n ubytes of compressed image data to
the pixel pack buffer or client memory pointed to by img, where n is the value
of TEXTURE_COMPRESSED_IMAGE_SIZE for the texture. The compressed image
data is formatted according to the definition of the texture’s internal format. All
pixel storage modes are ignored when returning a compressed texture image.
    Calling GetCompressedTexImage with an lod value less than zero or greater
than the maximum allowable causes an INVALID_VALUE error. Calling GetCom-
pressedTexImage with a texture image stored with an uncompressed internal for-
mat causes an INVALID_OPERATION error. If a pixel pack buffer object is bound
and img + n is greater than the size of the buffer, an INVALID_OPERATION error
results.
    The command

        boolean IsTexture( uint texture );

returns TRUE if texture is the name of a texture object. If texture is zero, or is a non-
zero value that is not the name of a texture object, or if an error condition occurs,
IsTexture returns FALSE. A name returned by GenTextures, but not yet bound, is
not the name of a texture object.

6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                                            264


may be called to determine whether sampler is the name of a sampler object. Is-
Sampler will return TRUE if sampler is the name of a sampler object previously
returned from a call to GenSamplers and FALSE otherwise. Zero is not the name
of a sampler object.
    The current values of the parameters of a sampler object may be queried by
calling

        void GetSamplerParameter{if}v( uint sampler,
           enum pname, T *params );
        void GetSamplerParameterI{i ui}v( uint sampler,
           enum pname, T *params );

sampler is the name of the sampler object from which to retrieve parameters.
pname is the name of the parameter to be queried. params is the address of an
array into which the current value of the parameter will be placed. GetSampler-
Parameter* accepts the same values for pname as SamplerParameter* (see sec-
tion 3.8.2). An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if sampler is not the name of a
sampler object previously returned from a call to GenSamplers. An INVALID_-
ENUM error is generated if pname is not the name of a parameter accepted by Get-
SamplerParameter*.
    Querying TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR with GetSamplerParameterIiv or Get-
SamplerParameterIuiv returns the border color values as signed integers or un-
signed integers, respectively; otherwise the values are returned as described in sec-
tion 6.1.2. If the border color is queried with a type that does not match the original
type with which it was specified, the result is undefined.

6.1.6     String Queries
String queries return pointers to UTF-8 encoded, NULL-terminated static strings
describing properties of the current GL context 1 . The command

        ubyte *GetString( enum name );

accepts name values of RENDERER, VENDOR, VERSION, and SHADING_-
LANGUAGE_VERSION. The format of the RENDERER and VENDOR strings is
implementation-dependent. The VERSION and SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION
strings are laid out as follows:

        <version number><space><vendor-specific information>
   1
     Applications making copies of these static strings should never use a fixed-length buffer, because
the strings may grow unpredictably between releases, resulting in buffer overflow when copying.

6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                           265


                             Value                         OpenGL Profile
             CONTEXT_CORE_PROFILE_BIT                      Core
         CONTEXT_COMPATIBILITY_PROFILE_BIT                 Compatibility


Table 6.2: Context profile bits returned by the CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK query.


The version number is either of the form major number.minor number or major -
number.minor number.release number, where the numbers all have one or more
digits. The minor number for SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION is always two dig-
its, matching the OpenGL Shading Language Specification release number. For
example, this query might return the string "3.30" while the corresponding
VERSION query returns "3.3".            The release number and vendor specific in-
formation are optional. However, if present, then they pertain to the server and
their format and contents are implementation-dependent.
     GetString returns the version number (in the VERSION string) that can be
supported by the current GL context. Thus, if the client and server support different
versions a compatible version is returned.
     The version, profile, and additional properties of the context may also be
queried by calling GetIntegerv with values MAJOR_VERSION and MINOR_-
VERSION, which respectively return the same values as major number and mi-
nor number in the VERSION string; with value CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK, which
returns a mask containing one of the bits in table 6.2, corresponding to the API
profile implemented by the context (see appendix E.1); or with value CONTEXT_-
FLAGS, which returns a set of flags defining additional properties of a context.
If CONTEXT_FLAG_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_BIT is set in CONTEXT_FLAGS, then
the context is a forward-compatible context as defined in appendix E, and the dep-
recated features described in that appendix are not supported; otherwise the context
is a full context, and all features described in the specification are supported.
     Indexed strings are queried with the command

      ubyte *GetStringi( enum name, uint index );

name is the name of the indexed state and index is the index of the particular ele-
ment being queried. name may only be EXTENSIONS, indicating that the extension
name corresponding to the indexth supported extension should be returned. index
may range from zero to the value of NUM_EXTENSIONS minus one. There is no
defined relationship between any particular extension name and the index values;
an extension name may correspond to a different index in different GL contexts
and/or implementations.

6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                                    266


    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index is outside the valid range for
the indexed state name.

6.1.7    Asynchronous Queries
The command
        boolean IsQuery( uint id );
returns TRUE if id is the name of a query object. If id is zero, or if id is a non-zero
value that is not the name of a query object, IsQuery returns FALSE.
    Information about a query target can be queried with the command
        void GetQueryiv( enum target, enum pname, int *params );
target identifies the query target, and must be one of SAMPLES_PASSED
or ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED for occlusion queries, PRIMITIVES_GENERATED
or TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN for primitive queries, or
TIME_ELAPSED or TIMESTAMP for timer queries.
    If pname is CURRENT_QUERY, the name of the currently active query for target,
or zero if no query is active, will be placed in params.
    If pname is QUERY_COUNTER_BITS, the implementation-dependent number of
bits used to hold the query result for target will be placed in params. The number
of query counter bits may be zero, in which case the counter contains no useful
information.
    For primitive queries (PRIMITIVES_GENERATED and TRANSFORM_-
FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN) if the number of bits is non-zero, the
minimum number of bits allowed is 32.
    For occlusion queries with target ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED, if the number of
bits is non-zero, the minimum number of bits is 1. For occlusion queries with tar-
get SAMPLES_PASSED, if the number of bits is non-zero, the minimum number
of bits allowed is a function of the implementation’s maximum viewport dimen-
sions (MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS). The counter must be able to represent at least two
overdraws for every pixel in the viewport. The formula to compute the allowable
minimum value (where n is the minimum number of bits) is


  n = min{32, log2 (maxV iewportW idth × maxV iewportHeight × 2) }.
    For timer queries (target TIME_ELAPSED and TIMESTAMP), if the number of
bits is non-zero, the minimum number of bits allowed is 30. This will allow at least
1 second of timing.
    The state of a query object can be queried with the commands

                        OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                             267


        void GetQueryObjectiv( uint id, enum pname,
           int *params );
        void GetQueryObjectuiv( uint id, enum pname,
           uint *params );
        void GetQueryObjecti64v( uint id, enum pname,
           int64 *params );
        void GetQueryObjectui64v( uint id, enum pname,
           uint64 *params );

If id is not the name of a query object, or if the query object named by id is currently
active, then an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated. pname must be QUERY_-
RESULT or QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE.
     If pname is QUERY_RESULT, then the query object’s result value is returned as
a single integer in params. If the value is so large in magnitude that it cannot be
represented with the requested type, then the nearest value representable using the
requested type is returned. If the number of query counter bits for target is zero,
then the result is returned as a single integer with the value zero.
     There may be an indeterminate delay before the above query returns. If pname
is QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE, FALSE is returned if such a delay would be re-
quired; otherwise TRUE is returned. It must always be true that if any query object
returns a result available of TRUE, all queries of the same type issued prior to that
query must also return TRUE.
     Querying the state for any given query object forces that occlusion query to
complete within a finite amount of time.
     If multiple queries are issued using the same object name prior to calling Get-
QueryObject*, the result and availability information returned will always be from
the last query issued. The results from any queries before the last one will be lost
if they are not retrieved before starting a new query on the same target and id.

6.1.8    Sync Object Queries
Properties of sync objects may be queried using the command

        void GetSynciv( sync sync, enum pname, sizei bufSize,
           sizei *length, int *values );

    The value or values being queried are returned in the parameters length and
values.
    On success, GetSynciv replaces up to bufSize integers in values with the cor-
responding property values of the object being queried. The actual number of
integers replaced is returned in *length. If length is NULL, no length is returned.

6.1. QUERYING GL STATE                                                                       268


    If pname is OBJECT_TYPE, a single value representing the specific type of the
sync object is placed in values. The only type supported is SYNC_FENCE.
    If pname is SYNC_STATUS, a single value representing the status of the sync
object (SIGNALED or UNSIGNALED) is placed in values.
    If pname is SYNC_CONDITION, a single value representing the condition of
the sync object is placed in values. The only condition supported is SYNC_GPU_-
COMMANDS_COMPLETE.
    If pname is SYNC_FLAGS, a single value representing the flags with which the
sync object was created is placed in values. No flags are currently supported.
    If sync is not the name of a sync object, an INVALID_VALUE error is generated.
If pname is not one of the values described above, an INVALID_ENUM error is
generated. If an error occurs, nothing will be written to values or length.
    The command

        boolean IsSync( sync sync );

returns TRUE if sync is the name of a sync object. If sync is not the name of a sync
object, or if an error condition occurs, IsSync returns FALSE (note that zero is not
the name of a sync object).
    Sync object names immediately become invalid after calling DeleteSync, as
discussed in sections 5.3 and D.2, but the underlying sync object will not be deleted
until it is no longer associated with any fence command and no longer blocking any
*WaitSync command.

6.1.9    Buffer Object Queries
The command

        boolean IsBuffer( uint buffer );

returns TRUE if buffer is the name of an buffer object. If buffer is zero, or if buffer is
a non-zero value that is not the name of an buffer object, IsBuffer returns FALSE.
    The commands

        void GetBufferParameteriv( enum target, enum pname,
           int *data );
        void GetBufferParameteri64v( enum target, enum pname,
           int64 *data );

return information about a bound buffer object. target must be one of the targets
listed in table 2.8, and pname must be one of the buffer object parameters in ta-
ble 2.9, other than BUFFER_MAP_POINTER. The value of the specified parameter
of the buffer object bound to target is returned in data.
     The command

      void GetBufferSubData( enum target, intptr offset,
         sizeiptr size, void *data );

queries the data contents of a buffer object. target must be one of the targets listed
in table 2.8. offset and size indicate the range of data in the buffer object that is
to be queried, in terms of basic machine units. data specifies a region of client
memory, size basic machine units in length, into which the data is to be retrieved.
    An error is generated if GetBufferSubData is executed for a buffer object that
is currently mapped.
    While the data store of a buffer object is mapped, the pointer to the data store
can be queried by calling

      void GetBufferPointerv( enum target, enum pname,
         void **params );

with target set to one of the targets listed in table 2.8 and pname set to BUFFER_-
MAP_POINTER. The single buffer map pointer is returned in params. GetBuffer-
Pointerv returns the NULL pointer value if the buffer’s data store is not currently
mapped, or if the requesting client did not map the buffer object’s data store, and
the implementation is unable to support mappings on multiple clients.
    To query which buffer objects are bound to the array of uniform buffer binding
points and will be used as the storage for active uniform blocks, call GetIntegeri v
with param set to UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING. index must be in the range zero
to the value of MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS - 1. The name of the buffer
object bound to index is returned in values. If no buffer object is bound for index,
zero is returned in values.
    To query the starting offset or size of the range of each buffer object bind-
ing used for uniform buffers, call GetInteger64i v with param set to UNIFORM_-
BUFFER_START or UNIFORM_BUFFER_SIZE respectively. index must be in the
range zero to the value of MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS - 1. If the param-
eter (starting offset or size) was not specified when the buffer object was bound,
zero is returned. If no buffer object is bound to index, -1 is returned.
    To query which buffer objects are bound to the array of transform feedback
binding points and will be used when transform feedback is active, call GetInte-
geri v with param set to TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_BINDING. index must

be in the range zero to the value of MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_-
ATTRIBS - 1. The name of the buffer object bound to index is returned in values.
If no buffer object is bound for index, zero is returned in values.
    To query the starting offset or size of the range of each buffer ob-
ject binding used for transform feedback, call GetInteger64i v with param
set to TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_START or TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_-
BUFFER_SIZE respectively. index must be in the range 0 to the value of MAX_-
TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS - 1. If the parameter (starting off-
set or size) was not specified when the buffer object was bound, zero is returned.
If no buffer object is bound to index, -1 is returned.

6.1.10   Vertex Array Object Queries
The command

      boolean IsVertexArray( uint array );

returns TRUE if array is the name of a vertex array object. If array is zero, or a
non-zero value that is not the name of a vertex array object, IsVertexArray returns
FALSE. No error is generated if array is not a valid vertex array object name.


6.1.11   Shader and Program Queries
State stored in shader or program objects can be queried by commands that ac-
cept shader or program object names. These commands will generate the error
INVALID_VALUE if the provided name is not the name of either a shader or pro-
gram object, and INVALID_OPERATION if the provided name identifies an object
of the other type. If an error is generated, variables used to hold return values are
not modified.
    The command

      boolean IsShader( uint shader );

returns TRUE if shader is the name of a shader object. If shader is zero, or a non-
zero value that is not the name of a shader object, IsShader returns FALSE. No
error is generated if shader is not a valid shader object name.
    The command

      void GetShaderiv( uint shader, enum pname, int *params );

returns properties of the shader object named shader in params. The parameter
value to return is specified by pname.
    If pname is SHADER_TYPE, VERTEX_SHADER, GEOMETRY_SHADER, or
FRAGMENT_SHADER is returned if shader is a vertex, geometry, or fragment shader
object respectively. If pname is DELETE_STATUS, TRUE is returned if the shader
has been flagged for deletion and FALSE is returned otherwise. If pname is
COMPILE_STATUS, TRUE is returned if the shader was last compiled successfully,
and FALSE is returned otherwise. If pname is INFO_LOG_LENGTH, the length of
the info log, including a null terminator, is returned. If there is no info log, zero is
returned. If pname is SHADER_SOURCE_LENGTH, the length of the concatenation
of the source strings making up the shader source, including a null terminator, is
returned. If no source has been defined, zero is returned.
    The command

      boolean IsProgram( uint program );

returns TRUE if program is the name of a program object. If program is zero, or a
non-zero value that is not the name of a program object, IsProgram returns FALSE.
No error is generated if program is not a valid program object name.
    The command

      void GetProgramiv( uint program, enum pname,
         int *params );

returns properties of the program object named program in params. The parameter
value to return is specified by pname.
     If pname is DELETE_STATUS, TRUE is returned if the program has been flagged
for deletion, and FALSE is returned otherwise. If pname is LINK_STATUS, TRUE
is returned if the program was last compiled successfully, and FALSE is returned
otherwise. If pname is VALIDATE_STATUS, TRUE is returned if the last call to Val-
idateProgram with program was successful, and FALSE is returned otherwise. If
pname is INFO_LOG_LENGTH, the length of the info log, including a null termina-
tor, is returned. If there is no info log, zero is returned. If pname is ATTACHED_-
SHADERS, the number of objects attached is returned. If pname is ACTIVE_-
ATTRIBUTES, the number of active attributes in program is returned. If no ac-
tive attributes exist, zero is returned. If pname is ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTE_MAX_-
LENGTH, the length of the longest active attribute name, including a null terminator,
is returned. If no active attributes exist, zero is returned. If pname is ACTIVE_-
UNIFORMS, the number of active uniforms is returned. If no active uniforms ex-
ist, zero is returned. If pname is ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH, the length of

the longest active uniform name, including a null terminator, is returned. If no
active uniforms exist, zero is returned. If pname is TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_-
BUFFER_MODE, the buffer mode used when transform feedback is active is re-
turned. It can be one of SEPARATE_ATTRIBS or INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS. If
pname is TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS, the number of varying variables
to capture in transform feedback mode for the program is returned. If pname is
TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH, the length of the longest vary-
ing name specified to be used for transform feedback, including a null termina-
tor, is returned. If no varyings are used for transform feedback, zero is returned.
If pname is ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS, the number of uniform blocks for pro-
gram containing active uniforms is returned. If pname is ACTIVE_UNIFORM_-
BLOCK_MAX_NAME_LENGTH, the length of the longest active uniform block name,
including the null terminator, is returned. If pname is GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT,
the maximum number of vertices the geometry shader will output is returned. If
pname is GEOMETRY_INPUT_TYPE, the geometry shader input type, which must
be one of POINTS, LINES, LINES_ADJACENCY, TRIANGLES or TRIANGLES_-
ADJACENCY, is returned. If pname is GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_TYPE, the geometry
shader output type, which must be one of POINTS, LINE_STRIP or TRIANGLE_-
STRIP, is returned. If GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT, GEOMETRY_INPUT_TYPE, or
GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_TYPE are queried for a program which has not been linked
successfully, or which does not contain objects to form a geometry shader, then an
INVALID_OPERATION error is generated.
     The command

      void GetAttachedShaders( uint program, sizei maxCount,
         sizei *count, uint *shaders );

returns the names of shader objects attached to program in shaders. The actual
number of shader names written into shaders is returned in count. If no shaders are
attached, count is set to zero. If count is NULL then it is ignored. The maximum
number of shader names that may be written into shaders is specified by maxCount.
The number of objects attached to program is given by can be queried by calling
GetProgramiv with ATTACHED_SHADERS.
    A string that contains information about the last compilation attempt on a
shader object or last link or validation attempt on a program object, called the
info log, can be obtained with the commands

      void GetShaderInfoLog( uint shader, sizei bufSize,
        sizei *length, char *infoLog );
      void GetProgramInfoLog( uint program, sizei bufSize,
        sizei *length, char *infoLog );

These commands return the info log string in infoLog. This string will be null-
terminated. The actual number of characters written into infoLog, excluding the
null terminator, is returned in length. If length is NULL, then no length is returned.
The maximum number of characters that may be written into infoLog, including
the null terminator, is specified by bufSize. The number of characters in the info
log can be queried with GetShaderiv or GetProgramiv with INFO_LOG_LENGTH.
If shader is a shader object, the returned info log will either be an empty string or
it will contain information about the last compilation attempt for that object. If
program is a program object, the returned info log will either be an empty string or
it will contain information about the last link attempt or last validation attempt for
that object.
    The info log is typically only useful during application development and an
application should not expect different GL implementations to produce identical
info logs.
    The command

      void GetShaderSource( uint shader, sizei bufSize,
         sizei *length, char *source );

returns in source the string making up the source code for the shader object shader.
The string source will be null-terminated. The actual number of characters written
into source, excluding the null terminator, is returned in length. If length is NULL,
no length is returned. The maximum number of characters that may be written into
source, including the null terminator, is specified by bufSize. The string source is
a concatenation of the strings passed to the GL using ShaderSource. The length
of this concatenation is given by SHADER_SOURCE_LENGTH, which can be queried
with GetShaderiv.
    The commands

      void GetVertexAttribdv( uint index, enum pname,
         double *params );
      void GetVertexAttribfv( uint index, enum pname,
         float *params );

obtain the vertex attribute state named by pname for the generic vertex attribute
numbered index and places the information in the array params. pname must
be one of VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING, VERTEX_ATTRIB_-
ARRAY_ENABLED,                VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_SIZE,                  VERTEX_-
ATTRIB_ARRAY_STRIDE, VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_TYPE, VERTEX_ATTRIB_-
ARRAY_NORMALIZED, VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_INTEGER, VERTEX_ATTRIB_-
ARRAY_DIVISOR, or CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB. Note that all the queries except
CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB return values stored in the currently bound vertex ar-
ray object (the value of VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING). If the zero object is bound,
these values are client state. The error INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is
greater than or equal to MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.
     All but CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB return information about generic vertex
attribute arrays. The enable state of a generic vertex attribute array is set by the
command EnableVertexAttribArray and cleared by DisableVertexAttribArray.
The size, stride, type, normalized flag, and unconverted integer flag are set by the
commands VertexAttribPointer and VertexAttribIPointer. The normalized flag
is always set to FALSE by VertexAttribIPointer. The unconverted integer flag is
always set to FALSE by VertexAttribPointer and TRUE by VertexAttribIPointer.
     The query CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB returns the current value for the
generic attribute index. GetVertexAttribdv and GetVertexAttribfv read and re-
turn the current attribute values as floating-point values; GetVertexAttribiv reads
them as floating-point values and converts them to integer values; GetVertexAt-
tribIiv reads and returns them as integers; GetVertexAttribIuiv reads and returns
them as unsigned integers. The results of the query are undefined if the current
attribute values are read using one data type but were specified using a different
one.
     The command

      void GetVertexAttribPointerv( uint index, enum pname,
         void **pointer );

obtains the pointer named pname for the vertex attribute numbered index and places
the information in the array pointer. pname must be VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_-
POINTER. The value returned is queried from the currently bound vertex array
object. If the zero object is bound, the value is queried from client state. An
INVALID_VALUE error is generated if index is greater than or equal to the value of
MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.
    The commands

      void GetUniformiv( uint program, int location,

      void GetUniformuiv( uint program, int location,
         uint *params );

return the value or values of the uniform at location location of the default uni-
form block for program object program in the array params. The type of the uni-
form at location determines the number of values returned. The error INVALID_-
OPERATION is generated if program has not been linked successfully, or if location
is not a valid location for program. In order to query the values of an array of uni-
forms, a GetUniform* command needs to be issued for each array element. If the
uniform queried is a matrix, the values of the matrix are returned in column major
order. If an error occurred, params will not be modified.

6.1.12   Framebuffer Object Queries
The command

      boolean IsFramebuffer( uint framebuffer );

returns TRUE if framebuffer is the name of an framebuffer object. If framebuffer is
zero, or if framebuffer is a non-zero value that is not the name of an framebuffer
object, IsFramebuffer return FALSE.
    The command

      void GetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv( enum target,
         enum attachment, enum pname, int *params );

returns information about attachments of a bound framebuffer object. tar-
get must be DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, READ_FRAMEBUFFER, or FRAMEBUFFER.
FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.
    If the default framebuffer is bound to target, then attachment must be one of
FRONT_LEFT, FRONT_RIGHT, BACK_LEFT, or BACK_RIGHT, identifying a color
buffer; DEPTH, identifying the depth buffer; or STENCIL, identifying the stencil
buffer.
    If a framebuffer object is bound to target, then attachment must be one of the
attachment points of the framebuffer listed in table 4.11.
    If attachment is DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT, and different objects are
bound to the depth and stencil attachment points of target, the query will fail and
generate an INVALID_OPERATION error. If the same object is bound to both at-
tachment points, information about that object will be returned.

    Upon successful return from GetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv, if
pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE, then param will contain
one of NONE, FRAMEBUFFER_DEFAULT, TEXTURE, or RENDERBUFFER, identify-
ing the type of object which contains the attached image. Other values accepted
for pname depend on the type of object, as described below.
    If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is NONE, no
framebuffer is bound to target. In this case querying pname FRAMEBUFFER_-
ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME will return zero, and all other queries will generate
an INVALID_OPERATION error.
    If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is not NONE,
these queries apply to all other framebuffer types:

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_RED_SIZE, FRAMEBUFFER_-
     ATTACHMENT_GREEN_SIZE,             FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_BLUE_-
     SIZE, FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_ALPHA_SIZE, FRAMEBUFFER_-
     ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_SIZE,            or      FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_-
     STENCIL_SIZE, then param will contain the number of bits in the
     corresponding red, green, blue, alpha, depth, or stencil component of the
     specified attachment. Zero is returned if the requested component is not
     present in attachment.

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_COMPONENT_TYPE, param will
     contain the format of components of the specified attachment, one of FLOAT,
     INT, UNSIGNED_INT, SIGNED_NORMALIZED, or UNSIGNED_NORMALIZED
     for floating-point, signed integer, unsigned integer, signed normalized fixed-
     point, or unsigned normalized fixed-point components respectively. Only
     color buffers may have integer components.

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING, param will
     contain the encoding of components of the specified attachment, one of
     LINEAR or SRGB for linear or sRGB-encoded components, respectively.
     Only color buffer components may be sRGB-encoded; such components
     are treated as described in sections 4.1.7 and 4.1.8. For the default frame-
     buffer, color encoding is determined by the implementation. For framebuffer
     objects, components are sRGB-encoded if the internal format of a color
     attachment is one of the color-renderable SRGB formats described in sec-
     tion 3.8.17.

   If   the value       of    FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE                 is
RENDERBUFFER, then

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME, params will con-
     tain the name of the renderbuffer object which contains the attached image.

    If the value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is TEXTURE, then

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME, then params will
     contain the name of the texture object which contains the attached image.

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LEVEL, then params
     will contain the mipmap level of the texture object which contains the at-
     tached image.

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_FACE and
     the texture object named FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME is a
     cube map texture, then params will contain the cube map face of the cube-
     map texture object which contains the attached image. Otherwise params
     will contain the value zero.

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER and the texture
     object named FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME is a layer of a
     three-dimensional texture or a one-or two-dimensional array texture, then
     params will contain the number of the texture layer which contains the at-
     tached image. Otherwise params will contain the value zero.

   • If pname is FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_LAYERED, then params will con-
     tain TRUE if an entire level of a three-dimesional texture, cube map texture,
     or one-or two-dimensional array texture is attached. Otherwise, params will
     contain FALSE.

   Any combinations of framebuffer type and pname not described above will
generate an INVALID_ENUM error.

6.1.13    Renderbuffer Object Queries
The command

      boolean IsRenderbuffer( uint renderbuffer );

returns TRUE if renderbuffer is the name of a renderbuffer object. If renderbuffer
is zero, or if renderbuffer is a non-zero value that is not the name of a renderbuffer
object, IsRenderbuffer return FALSE.

      void GetRenderbufferParameteriv( enum target, enum pname,
         int* params );

returns information about a bound renderbuffer object.                 target must be
RENDERBUFFER and pname must be one of the symbolic values in table 6.26. If
the renderbuffer currently bound to target is zero, then an INVALID_OPERATION
error is generated.
    Upon successful return from GetRenderbufferParameteriv, if pname
is RENDERBUFFER_WIDTH, RENDERBUFFER_HEIGHT, RENDERBUFFER_-
INTERNAL_FORMAT, or RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES, then params will contain
the width in pixels, height in pixels, internal format, or number of samples,
respectively, of the image of the renderbuffer currently bound to target.
    If pname is RENDERBUFFER_RED_SIZE, RENDERBUFFER_GREEN_-
SIZE,         RENDERBUFFER_BLUE_SIZE,                  RENDERBUFFER_ALPHA_SIZE,
RENDERBUFFER_DEPTH_SIZE, or RENDERBUFFER_STENCIL_SIZE, then
params will contain the actual resolutions (not the resolutions specified when
the image array was defined) for the red, green, blue, alpha depth, or stencil
components, respectively, of the image of the renderbuffer currently bound to
target.
    Otherwise, an INVALID_ENUM error is generated.
    In the tables that follow, a type is indicated for each variable. Table 6.3 explains
these types. The type actually identifies all state associated with the indicated
description; in certain cases only a portion of this state is returned. This is the case
with textures, where only the selected texture or texture parameter is returned.
    The M and m entries for initial minmax table values represent the maximum
and minimum possible representable values, respectively.


6.2    State Tables
The tables on the following pages indicate which state variables are obtained with
what commands. State variables that can be obtained using any of GetBooleanv,
GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, or GetDoublev are listed with just one of these com-
mands – the one that is most appropriate given the type of the data to be returned.
These state variables cannot be obtained using IsEnabled. However, state vari-
ables for which IsEnabled is listed as the query command can also be obtained
using GetBooleanv, GetIntegerv, GetFloatv, and GetDoublev. State variables
for which any other command is listed as the query command can be obtained by
using that command or any of its typed variants, although information may be lost
when not using the listed command. Unless otherwise specified, when floating-

Appendix A

Invariance

The OpenGL specification is not pixel exact. It therefore does not guarantee an ex-
act match between images produced by different GL implementations. However,
the specification does specify exact matches, in some cases, for images produced
by the same implementation. The purpose of this appendix is to identify and pro-
vide justification for those cases that require exact matches.


A.1     Repeatability
The obvious and most fundamental case is repeated issuance of a series of GL com-
mands. For any given GL and framebuffer state vector, and for any GL command,
the resulting GL and framebuffer state must be identical whenever the command is
executed on that initial GL and framebuffer state.
     One purpose of repeatability is avoidance of visual artifacts when a double-
buffered scene is redrawn. If rendering is not repeatable, swapping between two
buffers rendered with the same command sequence may result in visible changes
in the image. Such false motion is distracting to the viewer. Another reason for
repeatability is testability.
     Repeatability, while important, is a weak requirement. Given only repeata-
bility as a requirement, two scenes rendered with one (small) polygon changed
in position might differ at every pixel. Such a difference, while within the law
of repeatability, is certainly not within its spirit. Additional invariance rules are
desirable to ensure useful operation.

A.2. MULTI-PASS ALGORITHMS                                                       327


A.2     Multi-pass Algorithms
Invariance is necessary for a whole set of useful multi-pass algorithms. Such al-
gorithms render multiple times, each time with a different GL mode vector, to
eventually produce a result in the framebuffer. Examples of these algorithms in-
clude:

   • “Erasing” a primitive from the framebuffer by redrawing it, either in a dif-
     ferent color or using the XOR logical operation.

   • Using stencil operations to compute capping planes.

    On the other hand, invariance rules can greatly increase the complexity of high-
performance implementations of the GL. Even the weak repeatability requirement
significantly constrains a parallel implementation of the GL. Because GL imple-
mentations are required to implement ALL GL capabilities, not just a convenient
subset, those that utilize hardware acceleration are expected to alternate between
hardware and software modules based on the current GL mode vector. A strong
invariance requirement forces the behavior of the hardware and software modules
to be identical, something that may be very difficult to achieve (for example, if the
hardware does floating-point operations with different precision than the software).
    What is desired is a compromise that results in many compliant, high-
performance implementations, and in many software vendors choosing to port to
OpenGL.


A.3     Invariance Rules
For a given instantiation of an OpenGL rendering context:

Rule 1 For any given GL and framebuffer state vector, and for any given GL com-
mand, the resulting GL and framebuffer state must be identical each time the com-
mand is executed on that initial GL and framebuffer state.

Rule 2 Changes to the following state values have no side effects (the use of any
other state value is not affected by the change):

Required:

         • Framebuffer contents (all bitplanes)
         • The color buffers enabled for writing
         • Scissor parameters (other than enable)

A.4. WHAT ALL THIS MEANS                                                       328


         • Writemasks (color, depth, stencil)
         • Clear values (color, depth, stencil)

Strongly suggested:

         • Stencil parameters (other than enable)
         • Depth test parameters (other than enable)
         • Blend parameters (other than enable)
         • Logical operation parameters (other than enable)
         • Pixel storage state
         • Polygon offset parameters (other than enables, and except as they affect
           the depth values of fragments)

Corollary 1 Fragment generation is invariant with respect to the state values
marked with • in Rule 2.

Rule 3 The arithmetic of each per-fragment operation is invariant except with re-
spect to parameters that directly control it.

Corollary 2 Images rendered into different color buffers sharing the same frame-
buffer, either simultaneously or separately using the same command sequence, are
pixel identical.

Rule 4 The same vertex or fragment shader will produce the same result when
run multiple times with the same input. The wording ‘the same shader’ means a
program object that is populated with the same source strings, which are compiled
and then linked, possibly multiple times, and which program object is then executed
using the same GL state vector.

Rule 5 All fragment shaders that either conditionally or unconditionally assign
gl_FragCoord.z to gl_FragDepth are depth-invariant with respect to each
other, for those fragments where the assignment to gl_FragDepth actually is
done.


A.4     What All This Means
Hardware accelerated GL implementations are expected to default to software op-
eration when some GL state vectors are encountered. Even the weak repeatability
requirement means, for example, that OpenGL implementations cannot apply hys-
teresis to this swap, but must instead guarantee that a given mode vector implies

A.4. WHAT ALL THIS MEANS                                                        329


that a subsequent command always is executed in either the hardware or the soft-
ware machine.
    The stronger invariance rules constrain when the switch from hardware to soft-
ware rendering can occur, given that the software and hardware renderers are not
pixel identical. For example, the switch can be made when blending is enabled or
disabled, but it should not be made when a change is made to the blending param-
eters.
    Because floating point values may be represented using different formats in dif-
ferent renderers (hardware and software), many OpenGL state values may change
subtly when renderers are swapped. This is the type of state value change that Rule
1 seeks to avoid.

Appendix B

Corollaries

The following observations are derived from the body and the other appendixes of
the specification. Absence of an observation from this list in no way impugns its
veracity.

   1. The error semantics of upward compatible OpenGL revisions may change,
      and features deprecated in a previous revision may be removed. Otherwise,
      only additions can be made to upward compatible revisions.

   2. GL query commands are not required to satisfy the semantics of the Flush
      or the Finish commands. All that is required is that the queried state be con-
      sistent with complete execution of all previously executed GL commands.

   3. Application specified point size and line width must be returned as specified
      when queried. Implementation-dependent clamping affects the values only
      while they are in use.

   4. The mask specified as the third argument to StencilFunc affects the operands
      of the stencil comparison function, but has no direct effect on the update of
      the stencil buffer. The mask specified by StencilMask has no effect on the
      stencil comparison function; it limits the effect of the update of the stencil
      buffer.

   5. There is no atomicity requirement for OpenGL rendering commands, even
      at the fragment level.

   6. Because rasterization of non-antialiased polygons is point sampled, poly-
      gons that have no area generate no fragments when they are rasterized in
      FILL mode, and the fragments generated by the rasterization of “narrow”
      polygons may not form a continuous array.




                                       330
                                                                             331


7. OpenGL does not force left- or right-handedness on any of its coordinates
   systems.

8. (No pixel dropouts or duplicates.) Let two polygons share an identical edge.
   That is, there exist vertices A and B of an edge of one polygon, and vertices
   C and D of an edge of the other polygon; the positions of vertex A and C are
   identical; and the positions of vertex B and D are identical. Vertex positions
   are identical if the gl_Position values output by the vertex (or if active,
   geometry) shader are identical. Then, when the fragments produced by ras-
   terization of both polygons are taken together, each fragment intersecting the
   interior of the shared edge is produced exactly once.

9. Dithering algorithms may be different for different components. In particu-
   lar, alpha may be dithered differently from red, green, or blue, and an imple-
   mentation may choose to not dither alpha at all.

Compressed Texture Image
Formats

C.1     RGTC Compressed Texture Image Formats
Compressed texture images stored using the RGTC compressed image encodings
are represented as a collection of 4 × 4 texel blocks, where each block contains
64 or 128 bits of texel data. The image is encoded as a normal 2D raster image in
which each 4 × 4 block is treated as a single pixel. If an RGTC image has a width
or height that is not a multiple of four, the data corresponding to texels outside the
image are irrelevant and undefined.
    When an RGTC image with a width of w, height of h, and block size of block-
size (8 or 16 bytes) is decoded, the corresponding image size (in bytes) is:

                                w        h
                                    ×       × blocksize.
                                4        4
   When decoding an RGTC image, the block containing the texel at offset (x, y)
begins at an offset (in bytes) relative to the base of the image of:
                                       w        y       x
                        blocksize ×         ×       +        .
                                        4       4       4
    The data corresponding to a specific texel (x, y) are extracted from a 4×4 texel
block using a relative (x, y) value of

                             (x   mod 4, y     mod 4).
    There are four distinct RGTC image formats:

C.1.1   Format COMPRESSED_RED_RGTC1
Each 4 × 4 block of texels consists of 64 bits of unsigned red image data.
    Each red image data block is encoded as a sequence of 8 bytes, called (in order
of increasing address):

                 red0 , red1 , bits0 , bits1 , bits2 , bits3 , bits4 , bits5
   The 6 bits∗ bytes of the block are decoded into a 48-bit bit vector:


bits = bits0 +256×(bits1 + 256 × (bits2 + 256 × (bits3 + 256 × (bits4 + 256 × bits5 ))))
    red0 and red1 are 8-bit unsigned integers that are unpacked to red values
RED0 and RED1
    bits is a 48-bit unsigned integer, from which a three-bit control code is ex-
tracted for a texel at location (x, y) in the block using:


        code(x, y) = bits [3 × (4 × y + x) + 2 . . . 3 × (4 × y + x) + 0]
   where bit 47 is the most significant and bit 0 is the least significant bit.
   The red value R for a texel at location (x, y) in the block is given by:

C.1. RGTC COMPRESSED TEXTURE IMAGE FORMATS                                    334


    REDmin and REDmax are 0.0 and 1.0 respectively.
    Since the decoded texel has a red format, the resulting RGBA value for the
texel is (R, 0, 0, 1).

C.1.2   Format COMPRESSED_SIGNED_RED_RGTC1
Each 4 × 4 block of texels consists of 64 bits of signed red image data. The red
values of a texel are extracted in the same way as COMPRESSED_RED_RGTC1 ex-
cept red 0, red 1, RED 0, RED 1, REDmin , and REDmax are signed values
defined as follows:
    red0 and red1 are 8-bit signed (twos complement) integers.
                                     red0
                                    127.0,   red0 > −128
                       RED0 =
                                    −1.0,    red0 = −128
                                     red1
                                    127.0,   red1 > −128
                       RED1 =
                                    −1.0,    red1 = −128

                               REDmin = −1.0


                                REDmax = 1.0
   CAVEAT for signed red0 and red1 values: the expressions red0 > red1 and
red0 ≤ red1 above are considered undefined (read: may vary by implementation)
when red0 = −127 and red1 = −128. This is because if red0 were remapped to
-127 prior to the comparison to reduce the latency of a hardware decompressor, the
expressions would reverse their logic. Encoders for the signed red-green formats
should avoid encoding blocks where red0 = −127 and red1 = −128.

C.1.3   Format COMPRESSED_RG_RGTC2
Each 4 × 4 block of texels consists of 64 bits of compressed unsigned red image
data followed by 64 bits of compressed unsigned green image data.
    The first 64 bits of compressed red are decoded exactly like COMPRESSED_-
RED_RGTC1 above.
    The second 64 bits of compressed green are decoded exactly like
COMPRESSED_RED_RGTC1 above except the decoded value R for this second
block is considered the resulting green value G.
    Since the decoded texel has a red-green format, the resulting RGBA value for
the texel is (R, G, 0, 1).

C.1.4   Format COMPRESSED_SIGNED_RG_RGTC2
Each 4 × 4 block of texels consists of 64 bits of compressed signed red image data
followed by 64 bits of compressed signed green image data.
    The first 64 bits of compressed red are decoded exactly like COMPRESSED_-
SIGNED_RED_RGTC1 above.
    The second 64 bits of compressed green are decoded exactly like
COMPRESSED_SIGNED_RED_RGTC1 above except the decoded value R for this
second block is considered the resulting green value G.
    Since this image has a red-green format, the resulting RGBA value is
(R, G, 0, 1).

Appendix D

Shared Objects and Multiple
Contexts

This appendix describes special considerations for objects shared between multiple
OpenGL context, including deletion behavior and how changes to shared objects
are propagated between contexts.
    Objects that can be shared between contexts include pixel and vertex buffer ob-
jects, program and shader objects, renderbuffer objects, sync objects, and texture
objects (except for the texture objects named zero).
    Framebuffer, query, and vertex array objects are not shared.
    Implementations may allow sharing between contexts implementing differ-
ent OpenGL versions or different profiles of the same OpenGL version (see ap-
pendix E). However, implementation-dependent behavior may result when aspects
and/or behaviors of such shared objects do not apply to, and/or are not described
by more than one version or profile.


D.1     Object Deletion Behavior
D.1.1   Automatic Unbinding of Deleted Objects
When a buffer, texture, or renderbuffer object is deleted, it is unbound from any
bind points it is bound to in the current context, as described for DeleteBuffers,
DeleteTextures, and DeleteRenderbuffers. Bind points in other contexts are not
affected.

D.2. SYNC OBJECTS AND MULTIPLE CONTEXTS                                           337


D.1.2    Deleted Object and Object Name Lifetimes
When a buffer, texture, renderbuffer, query, or sync object is deleted, its name
immediately becomes invalid (e.g. is marked unused), but the underlying object
will not be deleted until it is no longer in use. A buffer, texture, or renderbuffer
object is in use while it is attached to any container object or bound to a context
bind point in any context. A sync object is in use while there is a corresponding
fence command which has not yet completed and signaled the sync object, or while
there are any GL clients and/or servers blocked on the sync object as a result of
ClientWaitSync or WaitSync commands. A query object is in use so long as it is
the active query object for a query type and index, as described in section 2.14.
     When a shader object or program object is deleted, it is flagged for deletion,
but its name remains valid until the underlying object can be deleted because it
is no longer in use. A shader object is in use while it is attached to any program
object. A program object is in use while it is the current program in any context.
     Caution should be taken when deleting an object attached to a container ob-
ject (such as a buffer object attached to a vertex array object, or a renderbuffer
or texture attached to a framebuffer object), or a shared object bound in multiple
contexts. Following its deletion, the object’s name may be returned by Gen* com-
mands, even though the underlying object state and data may still be referred to by
container objects, or in use by contexts other than the one in which the object was
deleted. Such a container or other context may continue using the object, and may
still contain state identifying its name as being currently bound, until such time
as the container object is deleted, the attachment point of the container object is
changed to refer to another object, or another attempt to bind or attach the name
is made in that context. Since the name is marked unused, binding the name will
create a new object with the same name, and attaching the name will generate an
error. The underlying storage backing a deleted object will not be reclaimed by
the GL until all references to the object from container object attachment points or
context binding points are removed.


D.2     Sync Objects and Multiple Contexts
When multiple GL clients and/or servers are blocked on a single sync object and
that sync object is signalled, all such blocks are released. The order in which blocks
are released is implementation-dependent.

D.3        Propagating Changes to Objects
GL objects contain two types of information, data and state. Collectively these
are referred to below as the contents of an object. For the purposes of propagating
changes to object contents as described below, data and state are treated consis-
tently.
    Data is information the GL implementation does not have to inspect, and does
not have an operational effect. Currently, data consists of:

       • Pixels in the framebuffer.

       • The contents of textures and renderbuffers.

       • The contents of buffer objects.

    State determines the configuration of the rendering pipeline and the driver does
have to inspect.
    In hardware-accelerated GL implementations, state typically lives in GPU reg-
isters, while data typically lives in GPU memory.
    When the contents of an object T are changed, such changes are not always
immediately visible, and do not always immediately affect GL operations involving
that object. Changes to an object may occur via any of the following means:

       • State-setting commands, such as TexParameter.

       • Data-setting commands, such as TexSubImage* or BufferSubData.

       • Data-setting through rendering to attached renderbuffers or transform feed-
         back operations.

       • Commands that affect both state and data, such as TexImage* and Buffer-
         Data.

       • Changes to mapped buffer data followed by a command such as Unmap-
         Buffer or FlushMappedBufferRange.

D.3.1       Determining Completion of Changes to an object
The contents of an object T are considered to have been changed once a command
such as described in section D.3 has completed. Completion of a command 1 may
   1
     The GL already specifies that a single context processes commands in the order they are received.
This means that a change to an object in a context at time t must be completed by the time a command
issued in the same context at time t + 1 uses the result of that change.

be determined either by calling Finish, or by calling FenceSync and executing a
WaitSync command on the associated sync object. The second method does not
require a round trip to the GL server and may be more efficient, particularly when
changes to T in one context must be known to have completed before executing
commands dependent on those changes in another context.

D.3.2     Definitions
In the remainder of this section, the following terminology is used:
   • An object T is directly attached to the current context if it has been bound to
     one of the context binding points. Examples include but are not limited to
     bound textures, bound framebuffers, bound vertex arrays, and current pro-
     grams.
   • T is indirectly attached to the current context if it is attached to another ob-
     ject C, referred to as a container object, and C is itself directly or indirectly
     attached. Examples include but are not limited to renderbuffers or textures
     attached to framebuffers; buffers attached to vertex arrays; and shaders at-
     tached to programs.
   • An object T which is directly attached to the current context may be re-
     attached by re-binding T at the same bind point. An object T which is indi-
     rectly attached to the current context may be re-attached by re-attaching the
     container object C to which T is attached.
        Corollary: re-binding C to the current context re-attaches C and its hierarchy
        of contained objects.

D.3.3     Rules
The following rules must be obeyed by all GL implementations:
Rule 1 If the contents of an object T are changed in the current context while T is
directly or indirectly attached, then all operations on T will use the new contents
in the current context.
    Note: The intent of this rule is to address state changes in a single context only.
The multi-context case is handled by the other rules.
    Note: “Updates” via rendering or transform feedback are treated consistently
with update via GL commands. Once EndTransformFeedback has been issued,
any command in the same context that uses the results of the transform feedback
operation will see the results. If a feedback loop is setup between rendering and
transform feedback (see above), results will be undefined.

D.3. PROPAGATING CHANGES TO OBJECTS                                                340


Rule 2 While a container object C is bound, any changes made to the contents
of C’s attachments in the current context are guaranteed to be seen. To guarantee
seeing changes made in another context to objects attached to C, such changes
must be completed in that other context (see section D.3.1) prior to C being bound.
Changes made in another context but not determined to have completed as de-
scribed in section D.3.1, or after C is bound in the current context, are not guar-
anteed to be seen.

Rule 3 State Changes to the contents of shared objects are not automatically prop-
agated between contexts. If the contents of a shared object T are changed in a con-
text other than the current context, and T is already directly or indirectly attached
to the current context, any operations on the current context involving T via those
attachments are not guaranteed to use its new contents.

Rule 4 If the contents of an object T are changed in a context other than the cur-
rent context, T must be attached or re-attached to at least one binding point in the
current context in order to guarantee that the new contents of T are visible in the
current context.
    Note: “Attached or re-attached” means either attaching an object to a binding
point it wasn’t already attached to, or attaching an object again to a binding point
it was already attached.
     Note: This rule also applies to the pointer to the data store of an object. The
pointer itself is state, while the content of the data store are data, not state. To
guarantee that another context sees data updates to an object, you should attach
or re-attach the object in that context, since the pointer to the data store could have
changed.
    Note: To be sure that a data update resulting from a transform-feedback opera-
tion in another context is visible in the current context, the app needs to make sure
that the command EndTransformFeedback has completed (see section D.3.1).
    Example: If a texture image is bound to multiple texture bind points and the
texture is changed in another context, re-binding the texture at any one of the
texture bind points is sufficient to cause the changes to be visible at all texture
bind points.

Appendix E

Profiles and the Deprecation
Model

OpenGL 3.0 introduces a deprecation model in which certain features may be
marked as deprecated. Deprecated features are expected to be completely removed
from a future version of OpenGL. Deprecated features are summarized in sec-
tion E.2.
    To aid developers in writing applications which will run on such future ver-
sions, it is possible to create an OpenGL 3.0 context which does not support dep-
recated features. Such a context is called a forward compatible context, while a
context supporting all OpenGL 3.0 features is called a full context. Forward com-
patible contexts cannot restore deprecated functionality through extensions, but
they may support additional, non-deprecated functionality through extensions.
    Profiles define subsets of OpenGL functionality targeted to specific applica-
tion domains. OpenGL 3.2 defines two profiles (see below), and future versions
may introduce additional profiles addressing embedded systems or other domains.
OpenGL 3.2 implementations are not required to support all defined profiles, but
must support the core profile described below.
    To enable application control of deprecation and profiles, new context creation
APIs have been defined as extensions to GLX and WGL. These APIs allow spec-
ifying a particular version, profile, and full or forward compatible status, and will
either create a context compatible with the request, or fail (if, for example, request-
ing an OpenGL version or profile not supported by the implementation),
    Only the ARB may define OpenGL profiles and deprecated features.




                                         341
E.1. CORE AND COMPATIBILITY PROFILES                                           342


E.1     Core and Compatibility Profiles
OpenGL 3.2 is the first version of OpenGL to define multiple profiles. The core
profile builds on OpenGL 3.1 by adding features described in section H.1. The
compatibility profile builds on the combination of OpenGL 3.1 with the special
GL_ARB_compatibility extension defined together with OpenGL 3.1, adding
the same new features and in some cases extending their definition to interact with
existing features of OpenGL 3.1 only found in GL_ARB_compatibility.
    It is not possible to implement both core and compatibility profiles in a sin-
gle GL context, since the core profile mandates functional restrictions not present
in the compatibility profile. Refer to the WGL_ARB_create_context_profile
and GLX_ARB_create_context_profile extensions (see appendix J.3.68) for
information on creating a context implementing a specific profile.


E.2     Deprecated and Removed Features
OpenGL 3.0 defined a set of deprecated features. OpenGL 3.1 removed most of the
deprecated features and moved them into the optional GL_ARB_compatibility
extension. The OpenGL 3.2 core profile removes the same features as OpenGL
3.1, while the optional compatibility profile supports all those features.
    Deprecated and removed features are summarized below in two groups: fea-
tures which are marked deprecated by the core profile, but have not yet been re-
moved, and features actually removed from the core profile of the current version
of OpenGL (no features have been removed from or deprecated in the compatibility
profile).
    Functions which have been removed will generate an INVALID_OPERATION
error if called in the core profile or in a forward-compatible context. Functions
which are partially removed (e.g. no longer accept some parameter values) will
generate the errors appropriate for any other unrecognized value of that parame-
ter when a removed parameter value is passed in the core profile or a forward-
compatible context. Functions which are deprecated but have not yet been removed
from the core profile continue to operate normally except in a forward-compatible
context, where they are also removed.

E.2.1   Deprecated But Still Supported Features
The following features are deprecated, but still present in the core profile. They
may be removed from a future version of OpenGL, and are removed in a forward-
compatible context implementing the core profile.




                  OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
E.2. DEPRECATED AND REMOVED FEATURES                                              343


   • Wide lines - LineWidth values greater than 1.0 will generate an INVALID_-
     VALUE error.

   • Global component limit query - the implementation-dependent values
     MAX_VARYING_COMPONENTS and MAX_VARYING_FLOATS.


E.2.2   Removed Features
   • Application-generated object names - the names of all object types, such as
     buffer, query, and texture objects, must be generated using the correspond-
     ing Gen* commands. Trying to bind an object name not returned by a Gen*
     command will result in an INVALID_OPERATION error. This behavior is al-
     ready the case for framebuffer, renderbuffer, and vertex array objects. Object
     types which have default objects (objects named zero), such as vertex ar-
     ray, framebuffer, and texture objects, may also bind the default object, even
     though it is not returned by Gen*.

   • Color index mode - No color index visuals are supplied by the window
     system-binding APIs such as GLX and WGL, so the default framebuffer
     is always in RGBA mode. All language and state related to color index
     mode vertex, rasterization, and fragment processing behavior is removed.
     COLOR_INDEX formats are also deprecated.

   • OpenGL Shading Language versions 1.10 and 1.20. These versions of the
     shading language depend on many API features that have also been depre-
     cated.

   • Begin / End primitive specification - Begin, End, and EdgeFlag*; Color*,
     FogCoord*, Index*, Normal3*, SecondaryColor3*, TexCoord*, Vertex*
     Vertex*; and all associated state. Vertex arrays and array drawing com-
     mands must be used to draw primitives. However, VertexAttrib* and the
     current vertex attribute state are retained in order to provide default attribute
     values for disabled attribute arrays.

   • Edge flags and fixed-function vertex processing - ColorPointer, EdgeFlag-
     Pointer, FogCoordPointer, IndexPointer, NormalPointer, Secondary-
     ColorPointer, TexCoordPointer, VertexPointer, EnableClientState, Dis-
     ableClientState, and InterleavedArrays, ClientActiveTexture; Frus-
     tum, LoadIdentity, LoadMatrix, LoadTransposeMatrix, MatrixMode,
     MultMatrix, MultTransposeMatrix, Ortho, PopMatrix, PushMatrix,
     Rotate, Scale, and Translate; Enable/Disable targets RESCALE_NORMAL

    and NORMALIZE; TexGen* and Enable/Disable targets TEXTURE_-
    GEN_*, Material*, Light*, LightModel*, and ColorMaterial, Shade-
    Model, and Enable/Disable targets LIGHTING. VERTEX_PROGRAM_TWO_-
    SIDE, LIGHTi, and COLOR_MATERIAL; ClipPlane; and all associated
    fixed-function vertex array, multitexture, matrix and matrix stack, normal
    and texture coordinate, lighting, and clipping state. A vertex shader must be
    defined in order to draw primitives.
    Language referring to edge flags in the current specification is modified as
    though all edge flags are TRUE.
    Note that the FrontFace and ClampColor commands are not deprecated,
    as they still affect other non-deprecated functionality; however, the Clam-
    pColor targets CLAMP_VERTEX_COLOR and CLAMP_FRAGMENT_COLOR are
    deprecated.

  • Client vertex and index arrays - all vertex array attribute and element array
    index pointers must refer to buffer objects. The default vertex array object
    (the name zero) is also deprecated. Calling VertexAttribPointer when no
    buffer object or no vertex array object is bound will generate an INVALID_-
    OPERATION error, as will calling any array drawing command when no ver-
    tex array object is bound.

  • Rectangles - Rect*.

  • Current raster position - RasterPos* and WindowPos*, and all associated
    state.

  • Two-sided color selection - Enable target VERTEX_PROGRAM_TWO_-
    SIDE; OpenGL Shading Language builtins gl_BackColor and gl_-
    BackSecondaryColor; and all associated state.

  • Non-sprite points - Enable/Disable targets POINT_SMOOTH and POINT_-
    SPRITE, and all associated state. Point rasterization is always performed as
    though POINT_SPRITE were enabled.

  • Wide lines and line stipple - LineWidth is not deprecated, but values greater
    than 1.0 will generate an INVALID_VALUE error; LineStipple and En-
    able/Disable target LINE_STIPPLE, and all associated state.

  • Quadrilateral and polygon primitives - vertex array drawing modes
    POLYGON, QUADS, and QUAD_STRIP, related descriptions of rasterization
    of non-triangle polygons, and all associated state.

E.2. DEPRECATED AND REMOVED FEATURES                                           345


  • Separate polygon draw mode - PolygonMode face values of FRONT and
    BACK; polygons are always drawn in the same mode, no matter which face
    is being rasterized.
  • Polygon Stipple - PolygonStipple and Enable/Disable target POLYGON_-
    STIPPLE, and all associated state.

  • Pixel transfer modes and operations - all pixel transfer modes, including
    pixel maps, shift and bias, color table lookup, color matrix, and convolu-
    tion commands and state, and all associated state and commands defining
    that state.
  • Pixel drawing - DrawPixels and PixelZoom. However, the language de-
    scribing pixel rectangles in section 3.7 is retained as it is required for Tex-
    Image* and ReadPixels.
  • Bitmaps - Bitmap and the BITMAP external format.
  • Legacy OpenGL 1.0 pixel formats - the values 1, 2, 3, and 4 are no longer
    accepted as internal formats by TexImage* or any other command taking
    an internal format argument. The initial internal format of a texel array is
    RGBA instead of 1.      TEXTURE_COMPONENTS is deprecated; always use
    TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT.

  • Legacy pixel formats - all ALPHA, LUMINANCE, LUMINANCE_ALPHA, and
    INTENSITY external and internal formats, including compressed, floating-
    point, and integer variants; all references to luminance and intensity formats
    elsewhere in the specification, including conversion to and from those for-
    mats; and all associated state. including state describing the allocation or
    format of luminance and intensity texture or framebuffer components.
  • Depth texture mode - DEPTH_TEXTURE_MODE. Section 3.8.16 is to be
    changed so that r is returned to texture samplers directly, and the OpenGL
    Shading Language 1.30 Specification is to be changed so that (r, r, r, 1) is
    always returned from depth texture samplers in this case.
  • Texture wrap mode CLAMP - CLAMP is no longer accepted as a value of
    texture parameters TEXTURE_WRAP_S, TEXTURE_WRAP_T, or TEXTURE_-
    WRAP_R.

  • Texture borders - the border value to TexImage* must always be zero, or
    an INVALID_VALUE error is generated (section 3.8.3); all language in sec-
    tion 3.8 referring to nonzero border widths during texture image specification
    and texture sampling; and all associated state.

E.2. DEPRECATED AND REMOVED FEATURES                                         346


  • Automatic mipmap generation - TexParameter* target             GENERATE_-
    MIPMAP, and all associated state.

  • Fixed-function fragment processing - AreTexturesResident, Prioritize-
    Textures, and TexParameter target TEXTURE_PRIORITY; TexEnv target
    TEXTURE_ENV, and all associated parameters; TexEnv target TEXTURE_-
    FILTER_CONTROL, and parameter name TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS; Enable tar-
    gets of all dimensionalities (TEXTURE_1D, TEXTURE_2D, TEXTURE_3D,
    TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, and TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP);
    Enable target COLOR_SUM; Enable target FOG, Fog, and all associated pa-
    rameters; the implementation-dependent values MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS and
    MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS; and all associated state.

  • Alpha test - AlphaFunc and Enable/Disable target ALPHA_TEST, and all
    associated state.

  • Accumulation buffers - ClearAccum, and ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT is not valid
    as a bit in the argument to Clear (section 4.2.3); Accum; the ACCUM_*_-
    BITS framebuffer state describing the size of accumulation buffer compo-
    nents; and all associated state.
    Window system-binding APIs such as GLX and WGL may choose to either
    not expose window configs containing accumulation buffers, or to ignore
    accumulation buffers when the default framebuffer bound to a GL context
    contains them.

  • Pixel copying - CopyPixels (the comments also applying to CopyTexImage
    will be moved to section 3.8.4).

  • Auxiliary color buffers, including AUXi targets of the default framebuffer.

  • Context framebuffer size queries - RED_BITS, GREEN_BITS, BLUE_BITS,
    ALPHA_BITS, DEPTH_BITS, and STENCIL_BITS.

  • Evaluators - Map*, EvalCoord*, MapGrid*, EvalMesh*, EvalPoint*, and
    all evaluator map enables, and all associated state.

  • Selection and feedback modes - RenderMode, InitNames, PopName,
    PushName,      LoadName, and SelectBuffer; FeedbackBuffer and
    PassThrough; and all associated state.

  • Display lists - NewList, EndList, CallList, CallLists, ListBase, GenLists,
    IsList, and DeleteLists; all references to display lists and behavior when

    associated state.

  • Hints - the PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, POINT_SMOOTH_HINT,
    FOG_HINT, and GENERATE_MIPMAP_HINT targets to Hint (section 5.4).

  • Attribute stacks - PushAttrib, PushClientAttrib, PopAttrib, Pop-
    ClientAttrib, the MAX_ATTRIB_STACK_DEPTH, MAX_CLIENT_ATTRIB_-
    STACK_DEPTH, ATTRIB_STACK_DEPTH, and CLIENT_ATTRIB_STACK_-
    DEPTH state, the client and server attribute stacks, and the values ALL_-
    ATTRIB_BITS and CLIENT_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS.

  • Unified extension string - EXTENSIONS target to GetString.

  • Token names and queries - all token names and queries not otherwise men-
    tioned above for deprecated state, as well as all query entry points where all
    valid targets of that query are deprecated state (chapter 6 and the state tables)

Version 3.0 and Before

OpenGL version 3.0, released on August 11, 2008, is the eighth revision since
the original version 1.0. When using a full 3.0 context, OpenGL 3.0 is upward
compatible with earlier versions, meaning that any program that runs with a 2.1 or
earlier GL implementation will also run unchanged with a 3.0 GL implementation.
OpenGL 3.0 context creation is done using a window system binding API, and
on most platforms a new command, defined by extensions introduced along with
OpenGL 3.0, must be called to create a 3.0 context. Calling the older context
creation commands will return an OpenGL 2.1 context. When using a forward
compatible context, many OpenGL 2.1 features are not supported.
    Following are brief descriptions of changes and additions to OpenGL 3.0. De-
scriptions of changes and additions in earlier versions of OpenGL (versions 1.1,
1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.1) are omitted in this specification, but may be
found in the OpenGL 3.0 Specification, available on the World Wide Web at URL

                         http://www.opengl.org/registry/


F.1    New Features
New features in OpenGL 3.0, including the extension or extensions if any on which
they were based, include:

   • API support for the new texture lookup, texture format, and integer and un-
     signed integer capabilities of the OpenGL Shading Language 1.30 specifica-

F.2    Deprecation Model
OpenGL 3.0 introduces a deprecation model in which certain features may be
marked as deprecated. The deprecation model is described in detail in appendix E,
together with a summary of features deprecated in OpenGL 3.0.




                  OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
F.3. CHANGED TOKENS                                                          350


          New Token Name                   Old Token Name
          COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE           COMPARE_R_TO_TEXTURE

          Table F.1: New token names and the old names they replace.



F.3    Changed Tokens
New token names are introduced to be used in place of old, inconsistent names.
However, the old token names continue to be supported, for backwards compati-
bility with code written for previous versions of OpenGL. The new names, and the
old names they replace, are shown in table F.1.


F.4    Change Log
Minor corrections to the OpenGL 3.0 Specification were made after its initial re-
lease.
    Changes in the draft of September 23, 2008:

   • Changed ClearBuffer* in section 4.2.3 to use DEPTH and STENCIL
     buffer names. Changed GetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv in sec-
     tion 6.1.12 to accept only DEPTH and STENCIL to identify default frame-
     buffer depth and stencil buffers, and only DEPTH_ATTACHMENT and
     STENCIL_ATTACMENT to identify framebuffer object depth and stencil
     buffers (bug 3744).

   Changes in the draft of September 18, 2008:

   • Added missing close-brace to ArrayElement pseudocode in section 2.8
     (bug 3897).

   • Noted in section 2.14 that BeginQuery will generate an INVALID_-
     OPERATION error when called with an existing query object name whose
     type does not match the specified target (bug 3712).

   • Add description of gl_ClipDistance to shader outputs in section 2.11.4
     and note that only one of gl_ClipVertex and gl_ClipDistance should
     be written by a shader (bug 3898).

  • Changed ClearBuffer* in section 4.2.3 to indirect through the draw
    buffer state by specifying the buffer type and draw buffer number, rather
    than the attachment name; also changed to accept DEPTH_BUFFER /
    DEPTH_ATTACHMENT and STENCIL_BUFFER / STENCIL_ATTACHMENT in-
    terchangeably, to reduce inconsistency between clearing the default frame-
    buffer and framebuffer objects. Likewise changed GetFramebufferAttach-
    mentParameteriv in section 6.1.12 to accept DEPTH_BUFFER / DEPTH_-
    ATTACHMENT and STENCIL_BUFFER / STENCIL_ATTACMENT interchange-
    ably (bug 3744).

  • Add proper type suffix to query commands in tables 6.4 and 6.33 (Mark
    Kilgard).

  • Update deprecation list in section E.2 to itemize deprecated state for two-
    sided color selection and include per-texture-unit LOD bias (bug 3735).

  Changes in the draft of August 28, 2008:

  • Sections 2.9, 2.9.3; tables 2.9, 2.10, and 6.7 - move buffer map/unmap
    calls into their own subsection and rewrite MapBuffer in terms of Map-
    BufferRange. Add buffer state BUFFER_ACCESS_FLAGS, BUFFER_MAP_-
    OFFSET, BUFFER_MAP_LENGTH. Make MapBuffer and MapBufferRange
    errors consistent (bug 3601).

  • Section 2.10 - Extend INVALID_OPERATION error to any array pointer-
    setting command called to specify a client array while a vertex array object
    is bound, not just VertexAttrib*Pointer (bug 3696).

  • Sections 2.13.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.1, and 4.3.3 - define initial state when a context is
    bound with no default framebuffer - null viewport and scissor region, draw
    buffer = read buffer = NONE, max viewport dims = max(display size - if any,
    max renderbuffer size). Viewport/scissor language added to the GLX and
    WGL create context extension specs as well (bug 2941).

  • Section 2.16 - define “word-aligned” to be a multiple of 4 (e.g. 32 bits) (bug
    3624).

  • Section 6.1.9 - Moved GetBufferParameteriv query from section 6.1.3
    and changed formal argument specifying the parameter name from value
    to pname (side effect of bug 3697).

  • Section 6.1.12 - Moved GetFramebufferAttachmentiv query from sec-
    tion 6.1.3. Querying framebuffer attachment parameters other than object

      type and name when no attachment is present is an INVALID_ENUM error.
      Querying texture parameters (level, cube map face, or layer) for a render-
      buffer attachment is also an INVALID_ENUM error (note that this was allowed
      in previous versions of the extension but the return values were not specified;
      it should clearly be an error as are other parameters that don’t exist for the
      type of attachment present). Also reorganized the description of this com-
      mand quite a bit to improve readability and remove redundancy and internal
      inconsistencies (bug 3697).

    • Section 6.1.13 - Moved GetRenderbufferParameteriv query from sec-
      tion 6.1.3 (side effect of bug 3697).

    • Appendix D.1 - add language to clarify that attachments to an object affect
      its reference count, and that object storage doesn’t go away until there are no
      references remaining (bug 3725).

    • Appendix E.2 - remove TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR and CLAMP_TO_BORDER
      mode from the deprecated feature list; they were put in by accident (bug
      3750).

    • Appendix F - Cite GL_EXT_texture_array instead of GL_EXT_-
      geometry_shader4 as the source of 1D/2D array texture functionality. Fix
      a typo. Add change log relative to initial 3.0 spec release.

                 OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
Appendix G

Version 3.1

OpenGL version 3.1, released on March 24, 2009, is the ninth revision since the
original version 1.0.
    Unlike earlier versions of OpenGL, OpenGL 3.1 is not upward compatible with
earlier versions. The commands and interfaces identified as deprecated in OpenGL
3.0 (see appendix F) have been removed from OpenGL 3.1 entirely, with the fol-
lowing exception:

   • Wide lines have not been removed, and calling LineWidth with values
     greater than 1.0 is not an error.

   Implementations may restore such removed features using the GL_ARB_-
compatibility extension discussed in section G.2.
   Following are brief descriptions of changes and additions to OpenGL 3.1.


G.1     New Features
New features in OpenGL 3.1, including the extension or extensions if any on which
they were based, include:

   • Support for OpenGL Shading Language 1.30 and 1.40.

   • Instanced rendering with a per-instance counter accessible to vertex shaders
     (GL_ARB_draw_instanced).

   • Data copying between buffer objects (GL_ARB_copy_buffer).

   • Primitive restart (GL_NV_primitive_restart). Because client en-
     able/disable no longer exists in OpenGL 3.1, the PRIMITIVE_RESTART




                                      355
G.2. DEPRECATION MODEL                                                             356


      state has become server state, unlike the NV extension where it is client
      state. As a result, the numeric values assigned to PRIMITIVE_RESTART and
      PRIMITIVE_RESTART_INDEX differ from the NV versions of those tokens.

   • At least 16 texture image units must be accessible to vertex shaders, in addi-
     tion to the 16 already guaranteed to be accessible to fragment shaders.

   • Texture buffer objects (GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object).

   • Rectangular textures (GL_ARB_texture_rectangle).

   • Uniform buffer objects (GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object).

   • Signed normalized texture component formats.


G.2     Deprecation Model
The features marked as deprecated in OpenGL 3.0 (see section E) have been re-
moved from OpenGL 3.1 (with the exception of line widths greater than one, which
are retained).
    As described by the deprecation model, features removed from OpenGL 3.0
have been moved into the new extension GL_ARB_compatibility. If an imple-
mentation chooses to provide this extension, it restores all features deprecated by
OpenGL 3.0 and removed from OpenGL 3.1. This extension may only be provided
in an OpenGL 3.1 or later context version.
    Because of the complexity of describing this extension relative to the OpenGL
3.1 core specification, it is not written up as a separate document, unlike other ex-
tensions in the extension registry. Instead, an alternate version of this specification
document has been generated with the deprecated material still present, but marked
in a distinct color.
    No additional features are deprecated in OpenGL 3.1.


G.3     Change Log
Changes in the specification update of May 28, 2009:

   • Update MAX_CLIP_DISTANCES from 6 to 8 in section 2.19 and table 6.38,
     to match GLSL (bug 4803).

   • Accept null pointers in CompressedTexImage* (section 3.8.5) and treat
     them the same as for the corresponding TexImage* commands (bug 4863).

G.4. CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                                                  357


    • Relax error conditions when specifying RGTC format texture images (sec-
      tion 3.8.4) and subimages (section 3.8.5) so that non-power-of-two RGTC
      images may be specified (also see section C.1), and edits to partial tiles at
      the edge of such an image made (bug 4856).

    • Relaxed texture magnification switch-over point calculation in section 3.8.12
      (bug 4392).

    • Clarify initial value of stencil value masks in section 4.1.4 and table 6.19
      (bug 4378).

    • Change     FramebufferTextureLayer          in   section   4.4.2    to   generate
      INVALID_VALUE for negative layer only if texture is non-zero (bug
      4084).

    • Clarify RenderbufferStorageMultisample language in section 4.4.2 to al-
      low, but not require creation of multisampled integer renderbuffers with more
      one sample (bug 4396).

    • Added language to section 6.1.4 disallowing data-type format mismatches
      between internal and external texture formats in GetTexImage (bug 4163).

    • Change initial value of FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_CUBE_-
      MAP_FACE in table 6.24 to NONE (bug 4407).

    • Brought extension list in appendix J.3 up to date and correctly described ex-
      tensions introduced along with OpenGL 3.0 and OpenGL 3.1 which imple-
      ment subsets of new functionality in those versions to enable older hardware.

    • Added missing contributors to the OpenGL 3.1 contributor list.

                 OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
Appendix H

Version 3.2

OpenGL version 3.2, released on August 3, 2009, is the tenth revision since the
original version 1.0.
     Separate versions of the OpenGL 3.2 Specification exist for the core and com-
patibility profiles described in appendix E, respectively subtitled the “Core Pro-
file” and the “Compatibility Profile”. This document describes the Core Profile.
An OpenGL 3.2 implementation must be able to create a context supporting the
core profile, and may also be able to create a context supporting the compatibility
profile.
     Material specific to the compatibility profile specification is marked in a dis-
tinct color to clearly call out differences between the two profiles.
     The OpenGL 3.2 core profile is upward compatible with OpenGL 3.1, but not
with earlier versions (see appendices G and F).
     The OpenGL 3.2 compatibility profile is upward compatible with the combina-
tion of OpenGL 3.1 and the GL_ARB_compatibility extension, as well as with
all earlier versions of OpenGL.
     Following are brief descriptions of changes and additions to OpenGL 3.2.


H.1     New Features
New features in OpenGL 3.2, including the extension or extensions if any on which
they were based, include:

   • Introduction of core and compatibility profiles, superseding the GL_ARB_-
     compatibility extension introduced with OpenGL 3.1.

   • Support for OpenGL Shading Language 1.50.




                                        360
H.2. DEPRECATION MODEL                                                       361


   • BGRA vertex component ordering (GL_ARB_vertex_array_bgra).

   • Drawing commands allowing modification of the base vertex index (GL_-
     ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex).

   • Shader fragment coordinate convention control (GL_ARB_fragment_-
     coord_conventions).

   • Provoking vertex control (GL_ARB_provoking_vertex).

   • Seamless cube map filtering (GL_ARB_seamless_cube_map).

   • Multisampled textures and texture samplers for specific sample locations
     (GL_ARB_texture_multisample).

   • Fragment depth clamping (GL_ARB_depth_clamp).

   • Geometry shaders (GL_ARB_geometry_shader4).

   • Fence sync objects (GL_ARB_sync).


H.2     Deprecation Model
In addition to restoring features removed from OpenGL 3.1 core, the compatibility
profile defines some additional interactions between those features and new fea-
tures introduced by OpenGL 3.2.
    The following features are newly deprecated by the OpenGL 3.2 core profile:

   • Global component limit query - the implementation-dependent values
     MAX_VARYING_COMPONENTS and MAX_VARYING_FLOATS.

   No features are deprecated by the OpenGL 3.2 compatibility profile.


H.3     Changed Tokens
New token names are introduced to be used in place of old, less general names.
However, the old token names continue to be supported, for backwards compati-
bility with code written for previous versions of OpenGL. The new names, and the
old names they replace, are shown in table H.1.

          Table H.1: New token names and the old names they replace.



H.4     Change Log
Minor corrections to the OpenGL 3.2 Specification were made after its initial re-
lease in the update of December 7, 2009:

   • Clean up description of GL command syntax in section 2.3, generalize the
     list of object types in the introduction to section 2.5 instead of enumerating
     them all redundantly, fix BindBuffer (section 2.9.1), BeginQuery (sec-
     tion 2.14), and BindTexture (section 3.8.1) to only generate errors for user
     generated names in the core profile, increase minimum number of clip half-
     spaces to 8 in section 2.19, improve formatting and correct column heading
     in tables 6.13 and 6.14, and a variety of minor editorial corrections not enu-
     merated here (Bug 5761).

   • Remove “just as if they were unused” from description of names generated
     by GenVertexArrays, GenFramebuffers, and GenRenderbuffers in sec-
     tions 2.10, 4.4.1, and 4.4.2 (Bug 5201).

   • Moved error language resulting from trying to put client pointers into VAOs
     from section 2.10 to section 2.8 (Bug 3975). This results in a forward refer-
     ence, unfortunately.

   • Remove reference to borders from texel fetch language in section 2.11.4 of
     the core specification (Bug 5343).

   • Remove INVALID_VALUE error when passing a program object to Trans-
     formFeedbackVaryings in section 2.11.6 (Bug 5661).

   • Changed number of query types from two to three in section 2.14 (Bug
     5624).

   • Change flat-shading source value description from “generic attribute” to
     “varying” in sections 3.5.1 and 3.6.1 (Bug 5359).

   • Remove leftover references in core spec sections 3.8.5 and 6.1.3 to depre-
     cated texture border state (Bug 5579). Still need to fix gl3.h accordingly.

  • Fix typo in second paragraph of section 3.8.8 (Bug 5625).

  • Simplify and clean up equations in the coordinate wrapping and mipmapping
    calculations of section 3.8.11, especially in the core profile where wrap mode
    CLAMP does not exist (Bug 5615).

  • Fix computation of u(x, y) and v(x, y) in scale factor calculations of sec-
    tion 3.8.11 for rectangular textures (Bug 5700).

  • Restructure definition of texture completeness in section 3.8.14 to sepa-
    rate mipmap consistency from filter requirements and cover new texture
    target types, and simplify how completness applies to texture fetches (sec-
    tion 2.11.4) and lookups (sections 2.11.4 and 3.9.2) (Bugs 4264, 5749).

  • Update sampling language in sections 3.8.14, 2.11.4, and 3.9.2 to not require
    texture completeness when non-mipmapped access to the texture is being
    done (Bug 4264, based on ES bugs 4282 and 3499).

  • Add fixed sample location state for multisample textures to section 3.8.15
    (Bug 5454).

  • Don’t use the sign of the input component in the description of dithering in
    section 4.1.9 (Bug 5594).

  • Change error condition for certain invalid buffers to DrawBuffers in sec-
    tion 4.2.1 from INVALID_OPERATION to INVALID_ENUM (Bug 5576).

  • Clarify error conditions in section 4.2.3 when the clear mask is zero or con-
    tains invalid bits (Bug 5567).

  • Change BlitFramebuffer in section 4.3.2 so format conversion is supported
    only within the three equivalence classes of fixed-point and floating point

    MAX_COMBINED_UNIFORM_BLOCKS in table 6.45 from 24 to 36 to reflect
    addition of geometry shaders (Bug 5607).

  • Update sharing rule 2 in appendix D.3.3 to read sensibly (Bug 5397).

    • Update sharing rule 4 in appendix D.3.3 to cover the case where an object is
      only attached or bound in a single place, clarify comments about transform
      feedback, and state that reattachment is required to guarantee seeing changes
      made in other contexts, but does not preclude implementations from making
      changes visible without reattachment (Bugs 5546, 5777).

                 OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
Appendix I

Version 3.3

OpenGL version 3.3, released on March 11, 2010, is the eleventh revision since the
original version 1.0.
     Separate versions of the OpenGL 3.3 Specification exist for the core and com-
patibility profiles described in appendix E, respectively subtitled the “Core Pro-
file” and the “Compatibility Profile”. This document describes the Core Profile.
An OpenGL 3.3 implementation must be able to create a context supporting the
core profile, and may also be able to create a context supporting the compatibility
profile.
     Material specific to the compatibility profile specification is marked in a dis-
tinct color to clearly call out differences between the two profiles.
     The OpenGL 3.3 compatibility and core profiles are upward compatible with
the OpenGL 3.2 compatibility and core profiles, respectively (see appendix H).
     Following are brief descriptions of changes and additions to OpenGL 3.3.


I.1      New Features
New features in OpenGL 3.3, including the extension or extensions if any on which
they were based, include:

      • Support for OpenGL Shading Language 3.30, including built-in functions
        for getting and setting the bit encoding for floating-point values (GL_ARB_-
        shader_bit_encoding - this extension only affects the shading language,
        not the API).

      • New blending functions whereby a fragment shader may output two colors,
        one of which is treated as the source color, and the other used as a blend-




                                         366
I.2. DEPRECATION MODEL                                                              367


        ing factor for either source or destination colors (GL_ARB_blend_func_-
        extended).

      • A method to pre-assign attribute locations to named vertex shader inputs
        and color numbers to named fragment shader outputs. This allows appli-
        cations to globally assign a particular semantic meaning, such as diffuse
        color or vertex normal, to a particular attribute location without knowing how
        that attribute will be named in any particular shader (GL_ARB_explicit_-
        attrib_location).

      • Simple boolean occlusion queries, which are often sufficient in preference to
        more general counter-based queries (GL_ARB_occlusion_query2).

      • Sampler objects, which separate sampler state from texture image data. Sam-
        plers may be bound to texture units to supplant the bound texture’s sampling
        state, and a single sampler may be bound to more than one texture unit si-
        multaneously, allowing different textures to be accessed with a single set of
        shared sampling parameters, or the same texture image data to be sampled
        with different sampling parameters (GL_ARB_sampler_objects).

      • A new texture format for unsigned 10.10.10.2 integer textures (GL_ARB_-
        texture_rgb10_a2ui).

      • A mechanism to swizzle the components of a texture before they are re-
        turned to the shader (GL_ARB_texture_swizzle).

      • A query object-based mechanism to determine the amount of time it takes to
        fully complete a set of GL commands without stalling the rendering pipeline
        (GL_ARB_timer_query).

      • Ability to specify an array ”divisor” for generic vertex array attributes, which
        when non-zero specifies that the attribute is instanced. An instanced attribute
        does not advance per-vertex as usual, but rather after every divisor concep-
        tual draw calls (GL_ARB_instanced_arrays).

      • Two new vertex attribute data formats, signed 2.10.10.10 and unsigned
        2.10.10.10 (GL_ARB_vertex_type_2_10_10_10_rev).


I.2      Deprecation Model
No new features are deprecated by OpenGL 3.3. Features deprecated by OpenGL
3.2 remain deprecated, but have not yet been removed.

                 OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
Appendix J

Extension Registry, Header Files,
and ARB Extensions

J.1    Extension Registry
Many extensions to the OpenGL API have been defined by vendors, groups of
vendors, and the OpenGL ARB. In order not to compromise the readability of
the GL Specification, such extensions are not integrated into the core language;
instead, they are made available online in the OpenGL Extension Registry, together
with extensions to window system binding APIs, such as GLX and WGL, and with
specifications for OpenGL, GLX, and related APIs.
    Extensions are documented as changes to a particular version of the Specifica-
tion. The Registry is available on the World Wide Web at URL

                        http://www.opengl.org/registry/


J.2    Header Files
Historically, C and C++ source code calling OpenGL was to #include a single
header file, <GL/gl.h>. In addition to the core OpenGL API, the APIs for all
extensions provided by an implementation were defined in this header.
     When platforms became common where the OpenGL SDK (library and header
files) were not necessarily obtained from the same source as the OpenGL driver,
such as Microsoft Windows and Linux, <GL/gl.h> could not always be kept
in sync with new core API versions and extensions supported by drivers. At this
time the OpenGL ARB defined a new header, <GL/glext.h>, which could be




                                       370
J.3. ARB EXTENSIONS                                                             371


obtained directly from the OpenGL Extension Registry (see section J.1). The com-
bination of <GL/gl.h> and <GL/glext.h> always defines all APIs for all
profiles of the latest OpenGL version, as well as for all extensions defined in the
Registry.
    <GL3/gl3.h> defines APIs for the core profile of OpenGL, together with
ARB extensions compatible with the core profile. It does not include APIs for
features only in the compatibility profile or for other extensions.
    <GL3/gl3ext.h> defines APIs for additional ARB, EXT, and vendor exten-
sions compatible with the core profile, but not defined in <GL3/gl3.h>. Most
older extensions are not compatible with the core profile.
    Applications using the compatibility profile (see appendices I and E) should
#include the traditional <GL/gl.h> and <GL/glext.h> headers.
    Applications using the core profile should #include the new
<GL3/gl3.h> and <GL3/gl3ext.h> headers introduced with OpenGL 3.1.
    By using <GL3/gl3.h> and <GL3/gl3ext.h>, instead of the legacy
<GL/gl.h> and <GL/glext.h>, newly developed applications are given in-
creased protection against accidentally using a “legacy” feature that has been re-
moved from the core profile This can assist in developing applications on a GL
implementation that supports the compatibility profile when the application is also
intended to run on other platforms supporting only the core profile.
    Developers should always be able to download <GL3/gl3.h> and
<GL3/gl3ext.h> from the Registry, with these headers replacing, or being used
in place of older versions that may be provided by a platform SDK.


J.3     ARB Extensions
OpenGL extensions that have been approved by the OpenGL Architectural Review
Board (ARB) are summarized in this section. ARB extensions are not required
to be supported by a conformant OpenGL implementation, but are expected to be
widely available; they define functionality that is likely to move into the required
feature set in a future revision of the specification.

J.3.1   Naming Conventions
To distinguish ARB extensions from core OpenGL features and from vendor-
specific extensions, the following naming conventions are used:

   • A unique name string of the form ”GL_ARB_name” is associated with each
     extension. If the extension is supported by an implementation, this string will




                   OpenGL 3.3 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010
J.3. ARB EXTENSIONS                                                           372


        be among the EXTENSIONS strings returned by GetStringi, as described in
        section 6.1.5.

   • All functions defined by the extension will have names of the form Func-
     tionARB

   • All enumerants defined by the extension will have names of the form
     NAME_ARB.

   • In additional to OpenGL extensions, there are also ARB extensions to the
     related GLX and WGL APIs. Such extensions have name strings prefixed by
     "GLX_" and "WGL_" respectively. Not all GLX and WGL ARB extensions
     are described here, but all such extensions are included in the registry.

J.3.2    Promoting Extensions to Core Features
ARB extensions can be promoted to required core features in later revisions of
OpenGL. When this occurs, the extension specifications are merged into the core
specification. Functions and enumerants that are part of such promoted extensions
will have the ARB affix removed.
     GL implementations of such later revisions should continue to export the name
strings of promoted extensions in the EXTENSIONS strings and continue to support
the ARB-affixed versions of functions and enumerants as a transition aid.
     For descriptions of extensions promoted to core features in OpenGL 1.3 and
beyond, see the corresponding version of the OpenGL specification, or the de-
scriptions of that version in version-specific appendices to later versions of the
specification.

J.3.3    Multitexture
The name string for multitexture is GL_ARB_multitexture. It was promoted to
a core feature in OpenGL 1.3.

J.3.4    Transpose Matrix
The name string for transpose matrix is GL_ARB_transpose_matrix. It was
promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.3.

J.3.5    Multisample
The name string for multisample is GL_ARB_multisample. It was promoted to a
core feature in OpenGL 1.3.

It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.3.

J.3.10    Point Parameters
The name string for point parameters is GL_ARB_point_parameters. It was
promoted to a core features in OpenGL 1.4.

J.3.11    Vertex Blend
Vertex blending replaces the single model-view transformation with multiple ver-
tex units. Each unit has its own transform matrix and an associated current weight.
Vertices are transformed by all the enabled units, scaled by their respective weights,
and summed to create the eye-space vertex. Normals are similarly transformed by
the inverse transpose of the model-view matrices.
    The name string for vertex blend is GL_ARB_vertex_blend.

J.3.12    Matrix Palette
Matrix palette extends vertex blending to include a palette of model-view matrices.
Each vertex may be transformed by a different set of matrices chosen from the
palette.
    The name string for matrix palette is GL_ARB_matrix_palette.

The name string for depth texture is GL_ARB_depth_texture. It was promoted
to a core feature in OpenGL 1.4.

J.3.18   Shadow
The name string for shadow is GL_ARB_shadow. It was promoted to a core feature
in OpenGL 1.4.

J.3.19   Shadow Ambient
Shadow ambient extends the basic image-based shadow functionality by allowing
a texture value specified by the TEXTURE_COMPARE_FAIL_VALUE_ARB texture
parameter to be returned when the texture comparison fails. This may be used for
ambient lighting of shadowed fragments and other advanced lighting effects.
    The name string for shadow ambient is GL_ARB_shadow_ambient.

J.3.20   Window Raster Position
The name string for window raster position is GL_ARB_window_pos. It was pro-
moted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.4.

J.3.21   Low-Level Vertex Programming
Application-defined vertex programs may be specified in a new low-level program-
ming language, replacing the standard fixed-function vertex transformation, light-
ing, and texture coordinate generation pipeline. Vertex programs enable many new
effects and are an important first step towards future graphics pipelines that will be
fully programmable in an unrestricted, high-level shading language.
    The name string for low-level vertex programming is GL_ARB_vertex_-
program.

J.3.22   Low-Level Fragment Programming
Application-defined fragment programs may be specified in the same low-level lan-
guage as GL_ARB_vertex_program, replacing the standard fixed-function vertex
texturing, fog, and color sum operations.
    The name string for low-level fragment programming is GL_ARB_-
fragment_program.

J.3.23   Buffer Objects
The name string for buffer objects is GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object. It was
promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.5.

J.3.24   Occlusion Queries
The name string for occlusion queries is GL_ARB_occlusion_query. It was
promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 1.5.

J.3.25   Shader Objects
The name string for shader objects is GL_ARB_shader_objects. It was pro-
moted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.26   High-Level Vertex Programming
The name string for high-level vertex programming is GL_ARB_vertex_shader.
It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.27   High-Level Fragment Programming
The name string for high-level fragment programming is GL_ARB_fragment_-
shader. It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.28   OpenGL Shading Language
The name string for the OpenGL Shading Language is GL_ARB_shading_-
language_100. The presence of this extension string indicates that programs
written in version 1 of the Shading Language are accepted by OpenGL. It was
promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.29   Non-Power-Of-Two Textures
The name string for non-power-of-two textures is GL_ARB_texture_non_-
power_of_two. It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.30   Point Sprites
The name string for point sprites is GL_ARB_point_sprite. It was promoted to
a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.31   Fragment Program Shadow
Fragment program shadow extends low-level fragment programs defined with
GL_ARB_fragment_program to add shadow 1D, 2D, and 3D texture targets, and
remove the interaction with GL_ARB_shadow.
   The name string for fragment program shadow is GL_ARB_fragment_-
program_shadow.

J.3.32   Multiple Render Targets
The name string for multiple render targets is GL_ARB_draw_buffers. It was
promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 2.0.

J.3.33   Rectangular Textures
Rectangular textures define a new texture target TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB that
supports 2D textures without requiring power-of-two dimensions. Rectangular
textures are useful for storing video images that do not have power-of-two sizes
(POTS). Resampling artifacts are avoided and less texture memory may be re-
quired. They are are also useful for shadow maps and window-space texturing.
These textures are accessed by dimension-dependent (aka non-normalized) texture
coordinates.
    Rectangular textures are a restricted version of non-power-of-two textures. The
differences are that rectangular textures are supported only for 2D; they require a
new texture target; and the new target uses non-normalized texture coordinates.

was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 3.1.

J.3.34   Floating-Point Color Buffers
Floating-point color buffers can represent values outside the normal [0, 1] range
of colors in the fixed-function OpenGL pipeline. This group of related exten-
sions enables controlling clamping of vertex colors, fragment colors throughout the
pipeline, and pixel data read back to client memory, and also includes WGL and
GLX extensions for creating frame buffers with floating-point color components
(referred to in GLX as framebuffer configurations, and in WGL as pixel formats).
    The name strings for floating-point color buffers are GL_ARB_color_-
buffer_float,        GLX_ARB_fbconfig_float,             and WGL_ARB_pixel_-
format_float. GL_ARB_color_buffer_float was promoted to a core
feature in OpenGL 3.0.

J.3.35   Half-Precision Floating Point
This extension defines the representation of a 16-bit floating point data format, and
a corresponding type argument which may be used to specify and read back pixel
and texture images stored in this format in client memory. Half-precision floats are
smaller than full precision floats, but provide a larger dynamic range than similarly
sized (short) data types.
    The name string for half-precision floating point is GL_ARB_half_float_-
pixel. It was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 3.0.


J.3.36   Floating-Point Textures

new internalformat arguments to commands which specify and read back texture
images.
   The name string for floating-point textures is GL_ARB_texture_float. It
was promoted to a core feature in OpenGL 3.0.

J.3.37   Pixel Buffer Objects
The buffer object interface is expanded by adding two new binding targets for
buffer objects, the pixel pack and unpack buffers. This permits buffer objects to be
used to store pixel data as well as vertex array data. Pixel-drawing and -reading
commands using data in pixel buffer objects may operate at greatly improved per-
formance compared to data in client memory.

in OpenGL 3.0 (see appendix G.2). GL implementations needing to maintain
these features to support existing applications may do so, following the depreca-
tion model, by exporting an extension string indicating those features are present.
Applications written for OpenGL 3.1 should not depend on any of the features cor-
responding to this extension, since they will not be available on all platforms with
3.1 implementations.
    The name string for restoration of features deprecated by OpenGL 3.0 is GL_-
ARB_compatibility.
