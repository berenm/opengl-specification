1 Overview
========================================================

This document describes GLX, the OpenGL extension to the X Window
System. It refers to concepts discussed in the OpenGL specification, and
may be viewed as an X specific appendix to that document. Parts of the
document assume some acquaintance with both the OpenGL and X.

In the X Window System, OpenGL rendering is made available as
an extension to X in the formal X sense: connection and authentication
are accomplished with the normal X mechanisms. As with other X extensions,
there is a de ned network protocol for the OpenGL rendering
commands encapsulated within the X byte stream.

Since performance is critical in 3D rendering, there is a way for
OpenGL rendering to bypass the data encoding step, the data copying,
and interpretation of that data by the X server. This direct rendering is
possible only when a process has direct access to the graphics pipeline.
Allowing for parallel rendering has a ected the design of the GLX interface.
This has resulted in an added burden on the client to explicitly
prevent parallel execution when that is inappropriate.

X and the OpenGL have di erent conventions for naming entry points
and macros. The GLX extension adopts those of the OpenGL.

2 GLX Operation
========================================================

2.1 Rendering Contexts and Drawing Surfaces
--------------------------------------------------------

The OpenGL specification is intentionally vague on how a rendering
context (an abstract OpenGL state machine) is created. One of the
purposes of GLX is to provide a means to create an OpenGL context
and associate it with a drawing surface.

In X, a rendering surface is called a Drawable. Windows, one type
of Drawable, are associated with a Visual. [*]_ The X protocol allows
for a single VisualID to be instantiated at multiple depths. The GLX
bindings allow only one depth for an OpenGL renderer for any given
VisualID. In GLX the definition of Visual has been extended to include
the types, quantities and sizes of the ancillary buffers (depth, accumulation,
auxiliary, and stencil). Double buffering capability is also xed
by the Visual. [*]_ The ancillary buffers have no meaning within the core
X environment. The set of extended Visuals is xed at server startup
time. One result is that a server can export multiple Visuals that di er
only in the extended attributes.

The other type of X Drawable is a Pixmap, a drawing surface that
is maintained o screen. The GLX equivalent to an X Pixmap is a
GLXPixmap. A GLXPixmap is created using the Visual along with its
extended attributes. The Visual is used to de ne the type and size of
the Ancillary buffers associated with the Pixmap. The Pixmap is used
as the front-left color buffer. A GLXDrawable is the union fWindow,
GLXPixmapg.

Ancillary buffers are associated with a GLXDrawable, not with a rendering
context. If several OpenGL renderers are all writing to the same
window, they will share those buffers. Rendering operations to one window
never a ect the unobscured pixels of another window, or of the
corresponding pixels of ancillary buffers of that window. If an Expose
event is received by the client, the values in the ancillary buffers and in
the back buffers for regions corresponding to the exposed region become
unde ned.

A rendering context can be used with multiple GLXDrawables as long
as those Drawables are similar. Similar means that the rendering contexts
and GLXDrawables are created with the same XVisualInfo.

An application can use any rendering context (subject to the restrictions
discussed in the section on address spaces) to render into any
similar GLXDrawable. An implication is that multiple applications can
render into the same window, each using a di erent rendering context.

.. [*] The association is with a fVisual, screen, depthg triple. An XVisualInfo is used
       by GLX functions since it can be interpreted unambiguosly.

.. [*] Any rendering system is free to use the ancillary buffers as long as it uses them
       in a manner consistent with the use by the OpenGL.

2.2 Using Rendering Contexts
--------------------------------------------------------

OpenGL de nes both client state and server state. Thus a rendering
context consists of two parts: one to hold the client state and one to
hold the server state. The client is responsible for creating a rendering
context and a drawable; defaults are not supplied.

Each thread can have at most one current rendering context. In
addition, a rendering context can be current for only one thread at one
time.

Issuing OpenGL commands may cause the X buffer to be ushed. In
particular, calling glFlush() will ush both the X and OpenGL rendering
streams.

Some state is shared between the OpenGL and X. The pixel values
in the X frame buffer are shared. The X double buffer extension (DBE)
has a definition for which buffer is currently the displayed buffer. This
information is shared with GLX. The state of which buffer is displayed
tracks in both extensions, independent of which extension initiates a
buffer swap.

2.3 Direct Rendering and Address Spaces
--------------------------------------------------------

One of the basic assumptions of the X protocol is that if a client can
name an object, then it can manipulate that object. GLX introduces
the notion of an Address Space. A GLX object cannot be used outside
of the address space in which it exists.

In a classic UNIX environment, each process is in its own address
space. In a multi-threaded environment, each of the threads will share a
virtual address space which references a common data region.

An OpenGL client that is rendering to a graphics engine directly
connected to the executing CPU may avoid passing the tokens through
the X server. This generalization is made for performance reasons. The
model described here specifically allows for such optimizations, but does
not mandate that any implementation support it.

When direct rendering is occurring, the address space of the renderer
is that of the direct process; when direct rendering is not being used, the
address space of the renderer is that of the X server. The client has
the ability to reject the use of direct rendering, but there may be a
performance penalty in doing so.

.. image:: images/glx/1.2-figure-1.png

Figure 1. Direct Rendering Block Diagram.

In order to use direct rendering, a client must create a direct rendering
context. Both the client context state and the server context state of
a direct rendering context exist in the client's address space; this state
cannot be shared by a client in another process. With indirect rendering
contexts, the client context state is kept in the client's address space and
the server context state is kept in the address space of the X server. In
this case the server context state is stored in an X resource; it has an
associated XID and may potentially be used by another client process.

2.4 OpenGL Display Lists
--------------------------------------------------------

Most OpenGL state is small and easily retrieved using the glGet* commands.
This is not true of OpenGL display lists, which are used, for
example, to encapsulate a model of some physical object. First, there is
no mechanism to obtain the contents of a display list from the rendering
context. Second, display lists may be large and numerous. It may
be desirable for multiple rendering contexts to share display lists rather
than replicating that information in each context.

GLX provides for limited sharing of display lists; the lists can be
shared only if the server state for the contexts share a single address
space. Using this mechanism, a single set of lists can be used, for instance,
by a context that supports color index rendering and a context
that supports RGBA rendering.

A group of shared display lists exists until the last referencing rendering
context is destroyed. All rendering contexts have equal access to
using lists or de ning new lists. Implementations sharing contexts must
handle the case where one rendering context is using a display list when
another rendering context destroys that list.

When display lists are shared between OpenGL contexts, the sharing
extends only to the display lists themselves and the information about
which display list numbers have been allocated. In particular, the value
of the base set with glListBase is not shared.

In general, OpenGL commands are not atomic. glEndList and
glDeleteLists are exceptions. The list named in a glNewList call
is not created or superseded until glEndList is called. If one rendering
context is sharing a display list with another, it will continue to use the
existing definition while the second context is in the process of re-de ning
it.

2.5 Texture Objects
--------------------------------------------------------

OpenGL texture state can be encapsulated in a named texture object.
A texture object is created by binding an unused name to one of the
texture targets (TEXTURE 1D or TEXTURE 2D) of a rendering context.
When a texture object is bound, OpenGL operations on the target
to which it is bound a ect the bound texture object, and queries of the
target to which it is bound return state from the bound texture object.

Texture objects may be shared by rendering contexts, as long as the
server portion of the contexts share the same address space. OpenGL
makes no attempt to synchronize access to texture objects. If a texture
object is bound to more than one context, then it is up to the programmer
to ensure that the contents of the object are not being changed via one
context while another context is using the texture object for rendering.
The results of changing a texture object while another context is using
it are unde ned.

A texture object will not be deleted until it is no longer bound to
any rendering context.

2.6 Aligning Multiple Drawables
--------------------------------------------------------

A client can create one window with an overlay Visual and a second with
a main plane Visual and then move them independently or in concert
to keep them aligned. This is a major change between the OpenGL and
the previous SGI proprietary GL: allocation of overlay planes and main
planes for every window is no longer done automatically. To accomplish
what was done by a drawmode/gcon g pair in previous versions of the
SGI proprietary GL, the OpenGL client can use the following paradigm:

* Make the windows which are to share the same screen area children
  of a single window (that will never be written). Size and position
  the children to completely occlude their parent. When the window
  combination must be moved or resized, perform the operation on
  the parent.
      
* Make the subwindows have a background of None so that the X
  server will not paint into the shared area when you restack the
  children.
      
* Select for device-related events on the parent window, not on the
  children. Since device-related events with the focus in one of the
  child windows will be inherited by the parent, input dispatching
  can be done directly without reference to the child on top.

2.7 Multiple Threads
--------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to create a version of the client side library that is protected
against multiple threads attempting to access the same connection. This
is accomplished by having appropriate definitions for LockDisplay and
UnlockDisplay. Since there is some performance penalty for doing the
locking, it is implementation-dependent whether a thread safe version, a
non-safe version, or both versions of the library are provided. Interrupt
routines may not share a connection (and hence a rendering context) with
the main thread. An application may be written as a set of co-operating
processes.

X has atomicity (between clients) and sequentiality (within a single
client) requirements that limit the amount of parallelism achievable
when interpreting the command streams. GLX relaxes these requirements.
Sequentiality is still guaranteed within a command stream, but
not between the X and the OpenGL command streams. It is possible, for
example, that an X command issued by a single threaded client after an
OpenGL command might be executed before that OpenGL command.

The X specification requires that commands are atomic:

  If a server is implemented with internal concurrency, the overall
  effect must be as if individual requests are executed to
  completion in some serial order, and requests from a given
  connection must be executed in delivery order (that is, the
  total execution order is a shuffle of the individual streams).

OpenGL commands are not guaranteed to be atomic. Some OpenGL
rendering commands might otherwise impair interactive use of the windowing
system by the user. For instance calling a deeply nested display
list or rendering a large texture mapped polygon on a system with no
graphics hardware could prevent a user from popping up a menu soon
enough to be usable.

Synchronization is in the hands of the client. It can be maintained
with moderate cost with the judicious use of the glFinish, glXWaitGL,
glXWaitX, and XSync commands. OpenGL and X rendering can be
done in parallel as long as the client does not preclude it with explicit
synchronization calls. This is true even when the rendering is being done
by the X server. Thus, a multi-threaded X server implementation may
execute OpenGL rendering commands in parallel with other X requests.

Some performance degradation may be experienced if needless
switching between OpenGL and X rendering is done. This may involve
a round trip to the server, which can be costly.

3 Functions and Errors
========================================================

3.1 Errors
--------------------------------------------------------

Where possible, as in X, when a request terminates with an error, the
request has no side effects.

The error codes that may be generated by a request are described
with that request. The following table summarizes the GLX-specific
error codes that are visible to applications:

GLXBadContext
  A value for a    Context    argument does not name a
  Context.

GLXBadContextState
  An attempt was made to switch to another
  rendering context while the current context was in RenderMode
  GL FEEDBACK or GL SELECT, or a call to glXMakeCurrent was
  made between a glBegin and the corresponding call to glEnd.
 
GLXBadCurrentWindow
  The current Drawable of the calling thread is a
  window that is no longer valid.
 
GLXBadDrawable
  The Drawable argument does not name a Drawable
  con gured for OpenGL rendering.

GLXBadPixmap The Pixmap argument does not name a Pixmap that is
  appropriate for OpenGL rendering.

GLXUnsupportedPrivateRequest May be returned in response to either
  a glXVendorPrivate request or a glXVendorPrivateWithReply
  request.

The following error codes may be generated by a faulty GLX implementation,
but would not normally be visible to clients:

GLXBadContextTag
  A rendering request    contains an invalid context tag.
  (Context tags are used to identify contexts in the protocol.)

GLXBadRenderRequest
  A glXRender request is ill-formed.

GLXBadLargeRequest
  A glXRenderLarge request is ill-formed.


3.2 Functions
--------------------------------------------------------

GLX functions should not be called between glBegin and glEnd operations.
If a GLX function is called within a glBegin/glEnd pair, then
the result is unde ned; however, no error is reported.

3.2.1 Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ascertain if the GLX extension is de ned for an X server, use

.. code:: cpp

  Bool glXQueryExtension(Display *dpy, int *error base, int *event base);

dpy specifies the connection to the X server. False is returned if the
extension is not present. error base is used to return the value of the
rst error code. The constant error codes should be added to this base
to get the actual value.

event base is included for future extension. GLX does not currently
de ne any events.

The GLX definition exists in multiple versions. Use

.. code:: cpp

  Bool glXQueryVersion(Display *dpy, int *major, int *minor);

to discover which version of GLX is available. Upon success, major and
minor are filled in with the major and minor versions of the extension implementation.
If the client and server both have the same major version
number then they are compatible and the minor version that is returned
is the minimum of the two minor version numbers.

major and minor do not return values if they are specified as NULL.

glXQueryVersion returns True if it succeeds and False if it fails.
If it fails, major and minor are not updated.

3.2.2 Configuration Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The constants shown in Table 1 are passed to glXGetConfig and glXChooseVisual
to specify which attributes are being queried.

Table 1: Configuration attributes.

GLX BUFFER SIZE gives   the total depth of the color buffer in bits. For
PseudoColor and StaticColor visuals, this is equal to the depth value
reported in the core X11 Visual. For TrueColor and DirectColor
visuals, GLX BUFFER SIZE is the sum of GLX RED SIZE, GLX GREEN SIZE,
GLX BLUE SIZE, and GLX ALPHA SIZE. Note that this value may be larger
than the depth value reported in the core X11 visual since it may include
alpha planes that may not be reported by X11. Also, for TrueColor
visuals, the sum of GLX RED SIZE, GLX GREEN SIZE, and GLX BLUE SIZE
may be larger than the maximum depth that core X11 can support.

To obtain a description of an OpenGL attribute exported by a Visual
use

.. code:: cpp

  int glXGetConfig(Display *dpy, XVisualInfo* *visual, int attribute, int *value);

glXGetConfig returns through value the value of the attribute of
visual.

glXGetConfig returns one of the following error codes if it fails,
and Success otherwise:

GLX NO EXTENSION
  dpy does not support the GLX extension.

GLX BAD SCREEN
  screen of visual does not correspond to a screen.

GLX BAD ATTRIBUTE
  attribute is not a valid GLX attribute.

GLX BAD VISUAL
  visual does not support GLX and an attribute other
  than GLX USE GL was specified.

GLX BAD VALUE
  parameter invalid

A GLX implementation may export many visuals that support
OpenGL. These visuals support either color index or RGBA rendering.
Currently RGBA rendering can be supported only by Visuals of type
TrueColor or DirectColor and color index rendering can be supported
only by Visuals of type PseudoColor or StaticColor.

Servers are required to export at least one visual that supports RGBA
rendering. At least one of the visuals that supports RGBA rendering
must have at least one color buffer, a stencil buffer of at least 1 bit,
a depth buffer of at least 12 bits, and an accumulation buffer; alpha
bitplanes are optional. The color buffer size for this visual must be as
large as that of the deepest TrueColor, DirectColor, PseudoColor,
or StaticColor visual supported on framebuffer level zero (the main
image planes), and it must be available on framebuffer level zero.

Table 2: Defaults and selection criteria used by glXChooseVisual.

If the X server exports a PseudoColor or StaticColor visual on
framebuffer level 0, a visual that supports color index rendering is also
required. If color index rendering is supported then one of the visuals
that supports color index rendering must have at least one color buffer,
a stencil buffer of at least 1 bit, and a depth buffer of at least 12 bits.
It also must have as many color bitplanes as the deepest PseudoColor
or StaticColor visual supported on framebuffer level zero, and it must
itself be made available on level zero.

glXChooseVisual is used to nd a visual that matches the client's
specified attributes.

.. code:: cpp

  XVisualInfo* glXChooseVisual(Display *dpy, int screen, int *attrib list);

glXChooseVisual returns a pointer to an XVisualInfo structure
describing the visual that best matches the specified attributes. If no
matching visual exists, NULL is returned.

The attributes are matched in an attribute-specific manner, as
shown in Table 2. Some of the attributes, such as GLX LEVEL, must
match the specified value exactly; others, such as, GLX BUFFER SIZE and
GLX RED SIZE must meet or exceed the specified minimum values. In
the case of GLX BUFFER SIZE, preference is given based on how close the
visual's attribute value is to the specified value. (Attributes that are
matched in this manner have minimum, smallest listed as their selection
criteria in Table 2.) In the case of GLX RED SIZE, if the specified
value is non-zero, then preference is given to visuals with the largest
value for this attribute; otherwise preference is given to visuals with
the smallest value. (Attributes that are matched in this manner have
minimum, largest listed as their selection criteria in Table 2.)

If GLX RGBA is in attrib list then the resulting visual will be TrueColor
or DirectColor. If all other attributes are equivalent, then a TrueColor
visual will be chosen in preference to a DirectColor visual.

If GLX RGBA is not in attrib list then the returned visual will be
PseudoColor or StaticColor. If all other attributes are equivalent then
a PseudoColor visual will be chosen in preference to a StaticColor visual.

If an attribute is not specified in attrib list, then the default value is
used. See Table 2 for a list of defaults.

Default specifications are superseded by the attributes included in attrib
list. Integer attributes are immediately followed by the corresponding
desired value. Boolean attributes appearing in attrib list have an
implicit True value; such attributes are never followed by an explicit
True or False value. The list is terminated with None.

To free the data returned, use XFree.

NULL is returned if an unde ned GLX attribute is encountered.

3.2.3 O Screen Rendering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an o screen rendering area, rst create an X Pixmap of the
depth specified by the desired Visual, then call

.. code:: cpp

  GLXPixmap glXCreateGLXPixmap(Display *dpy, XVisualInfo* visual, Pixmap pixmap);

glXCreateGLXPixmap creates an o screen rendering area and
returns its XID. Any GLX rendering context created with respect to
visual can be used to render into this o screen area.

pixmap is used for the RGB planes of the front-left buffer of the
resulting GLX o screen rendering area. The alpha buffer and ancillary
buffers specified by visual are created without externally visible names.
GLX pixmaps may be created with a visual that includes back buffers
and stereoscopic buffers. However, glXSwapBuffers is ignored for these
pixmaps.

A direct rendering context might not be able to be made current with
a GLXPixmap.

If the depth of pixmap does not match the depth value reported by
core X11 for visual, or if pixmap was not created with respect to the
same screen as visual, then a BadMatch error is generated. If visual is
not valid (e.g., if GLX does not support it), then a BadValue error is
generated. If pixmap is not a valid pixmap id, then a BadPixmap error is
generated. Finally, if the server cannot allocate the new GLX pixmap,
a BadAlloc error is generated.

A GLXPixmap is destroyed by calling

.. code:: cpp

  void glXDestroyGLXPixmap(Display *dpy, GLXPixmap pixmap);

This request deletes the association between the resource ID pixmap
and the GLX pixmap. The storage will be freed when it is not current
to any client.

If pixmap is not a valid GLX pixmap then a GLXBadPixmap error is
generated.

3.2.4 Rendering Contexts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an OpenGL rendering context call

.. code:: cpp

  GLXContext glXCreateContext(Display *dpy, XVisualInfo* visual, GLXContext share list, Bool direct);

glXCreateContext returns NULL if it fails. If glXCreateContext
succeeds, it initializes the rendering context to the default OpenGL state
and returns a handle to it. This handle can be used to render to both
windows and GLX pixmaps.

If share list is not NULL, then all display lists and texture objects
except texture objects named 0 will be shared by share list and the newly
created rendering context. An arbitrary number of GLXContexts can
share a single display list and texture object space. All sharing contexts
must also share a single address space or a BadMatch error is generated.

If direct is true, then a direct rendering context will be created if the
implementation supports direct rendering and the connection is to an
X server that is local. If direct is False, then a rendering context that
renders through the X server is created.

Direct rendering contexts may be a scarce resource in some implementations.
If direct is true, and if a direct rendering context cannot
be created, then glXCreateContext will attempt to create an indirect
context instead.

glXCreateContext can generate the following GLX extension errors:
GLXBadContext if share list is neither zero nor a valid GLX rendering
context; BadValue if visual is not a valid X Visual or if GLX does not
support it; BadMatch if share list de nes an address space that cannot
be shared with the newly created context or if share list was created on a
di erent screen than the one referenced by visual; BadAlloc if the server
does not have enough resources to allocate the new context.

To determine if an OpenGL rendering context is direct call

.. code:: cpp

  Bool glXIsDirect(Display *dpy, GLXContext ctx);

glXIsDirect returns True if ctx is a direct rendering context, False
otherwise. If ctx is not a valid GLX rendering context, a GLXBadContext
error is generated.

An OpenGL rendering context is destroyed by calling

.. code:: cpp

  void glXDestroyContext(Display *dpy, GLXContext ctx);

If ctx is still current to any thread, ctx is not destroyed until it is no
longer current. In any event, the associated XID will be destroyed and
ctx cannot subsequently be made current to any thread.

glXDestroyContext will generate a GLXBadContext error if ctx is
not a valid rendering context.

To copy OpenGL rendering state from one context to another, use

.. code:: cpp

  void glXCopyContext(Display *dpy, GLXContext source, GLXContext dest, unsigned long mask);

glXCopyContext copies selected groups of state variables from source
to dest. mask indicates which groups of state variables are to be copied;
it contains the bitwise OR of the symbolic names for the attribute
groups. The symbolic names are the same as those used by glPushAttrib,
described in the OpenGL Speci cation. Also, the order in which
the attributes are copied to dest as a result of the glXCopyContext
operation is the same as the order in which they are popped o of
the stack when glPopAttrib is called. The single symbolic constant
GL ALL ATTRIB BITS can be used to copy the maximum possible portion
of the rendering state. It is not an error to specify mask bits that are
unde ned.

If source and dest do not share an address space or were not created
on the same screen, a BadMatch error is generated. (source and dest
may be based on di erent X visuals and still share an address space;
glXCopyContext will work correctly in such cases. ) If the destination
context is current for some thread then a BadAccess error is generated.
If the source context is the same as the current context of the calling
thread, and the current drawable of the calling thread is a window that
is no longer valid, a GLXBadCurrentWindow is generated. Finally, if either
source or dest is not a valid GLX rendering context, a GLXBadContext
error is generated.

glXCopyContext performs an implicit glFlush() if source is the
current context for the calling thread.

Only one rendering context may be in use, or current, for a particular
thread at a given time. The minimum number of current rendering
contexts that must be supported by a GLX implementation is
one. (Supporting a larger number of current rendering contexts is essential
for general-purpose systems, but may not be necessary for turnkey
applications.)

To make a context current, call

.. code:: cpp

  Bool glXMakeCurrent(Display *dpy, GLXDrawable drawable, GLXContext ctx);

If the calling thread already has a current rendering context, then
that context is ushed and marked as no longer current. ctx is made the
current context for the calling thread.

If the drawable and ctx are not similar, a BadMatch error is generated.
If ctx is current to some other thread, then glXMakeCurrent
will generate a BadAccess error. GLXBadContextState is generated
if there is a current rendering context and its render mode is either
GL FEEDBACK or GL SELECT. GLXBadContextState will also
be generated if glXMakeCurrent is called between a glBegin and
its corresponding glEnd. If ctx is not a valid GLX rendering context,
GLXBadContext is generated. If drawable is not a valid GLX drawable, a
GLXBadDrawable error is generated. If the previous context of the calling
thread has un ushed commands, and the previous drawable is a window
that is no longer valid, GLXBadCurrentWindow is generated. Finally, note
that the ancillary buffers for drawable need not be allocated until they
are needed. A BadAlloc error will be generated if the server does not
have enough resources to allocate the buffers.

If drawable is destroyed after glXMakeCurrent is called then subsequent
rendering commands will behave as if drawable is bound to the
NULL clip. The commands will be processed and the context state will
be updated, but no output will appear on the display.

To release the current context without assigning a new one, use NULL
for ctx and None for drawable. If ctx is NULL and drawable is not None,
or if drawable is None and ctx is not NULL, then a BadMatch error will be
generated.

The rst time ctx is made current to a GLXDrawable, its initial viewport
is set. That viewport must be reset by the client when ctx is subsequently
made current.

Note that when multiple threads are using their current contexts
to render to the same drawable, OpenGL does not guarantee atomicity
of fragment update operations. In particular, programmers may not
assume that depth-buffering will automatically work correctly; there is
a race condition between threads that read and update the depth buffer.
Clients are responsible for avoiding this condition. They may use vendorspecific
extensions or they may arrange for separate threads to draw in
disjoint regions of the framebuffer, for example.

glXGetCurrentContext returns the current context.

.. code:: cpp

  GLXContext glXGetCurrentContext(void);

If there is no current context, NULL is returned.

glXGetCurrentDrawable returns the XID of the current drawable.

.. code:: cpp

  GLXDrawable glXGetCurrentDrawable(void);

If there is no current drawable, None is returned.

To get the display associated with the current context and drawable,
call

.. code:: cpp

  Display* glXGetCurrentDisplay(void);

If there is no current context, NULL is returned. This routine is
available only if the GLX version is 1.2 or later.

glXGet* calls retrieve client-side state and do not force a round trip
to the X server. Unlike most X calls (including the glXQuery* calls)
that return a value, these calls do not ush any pending requests.

3.2.5 Synchronization Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent X requests from executing until any outstanding OpenGL
rendering is done, call

.. code:: cpp

  void glXWaitGL(void);

OpenGL calls made prior to glXWaitGL are guaranteed to be executed
before X rendering calls made after glXWaitGL. While the same result
can be achieved using glFinish, glXWaitGL does not require a round
trip to the server, and is therefore more e cient in cases where the client
and server are on separate machines.

glXWaitGL is ignored if there is no current rendering context. If the
drawable associated with the calling thread's current context is a window
that is no longer valid, a GLXBadCurrentWindow error is generated.

To prevent the OpenGL command sequence from executing until any
outstanding X requests are completed, call

.. code:: cpp

  void glXWaitX(void);

X rendering calls made prior to glXWaitX are guaranteed to be executed
before OpenGL rendering calls made after glXWaitX. While the
same result can be achieved using XSync, glXWaitX does not require
a round trip to the server, and may therefore be more e cient.

glXWaitX is ignored if there is no current rendering context. If the
drawable associated with the calling thread's current context is a window
that is no longer valid, a GLXBadCurrentWindow error is generated.

3.2.6 Double Buffering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For drawables that are double buffered, the contents of the back buffer
can be made potentially visible (i.e., become the contents of the front
buffer) by calling

.. code:: cpp

  void glXSwapBuffers(Display *dpy, GLXDrawable drawable);

The contents of the back buffer then become unde ned. This operation
is a no-op if drawable was created with a non-double-buffered visual, or
if drawable is a GLXPixmap.

All GLX rendering contexts share the same notion of which are front
buffers and which are back buffers for a given drawable. This notion is
also shared with the X double buffer extension (DBE).

When multiple threads are rendering to the same drawable, only one
of them need call glXSwapBuffers and all of them will see the effect
of the swap. The client must synchronize the threads that perform the
swap and the rendering, using some means outside the scope of GLX,
to insure that each new frame is completely rendered before it is made
visible.

If dpy and drawable are the display and drawable for the calling
thread's current context, glXSwapBuffers performs an implicit
glFlush(). Subsequent OpenGL commands can be issued immediately,
but will not be executed until the buffer swapping has completed, typically
during vertical retrace of the display monitor.

If drawable is not a valid GLX drawable, glXSwapBuffers generates
a GLXBadDrawable error. If dpy and drawable are the display and drawable
associated with the calling thread's current context, and if drawable
is a window that is no longer valid, a GLXBadCurrentWindow error is
generated.

3.2.7 Access to X Fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shortcut for using X fonts is provided by the command

.. code:: cpp

  void glXUseXFont(Font font, int rst, int count, int list base);

count display lists are de ned starting at list base, each list consisting
of a single call on glBitmap. The definition of bitmap list base + i is
taken from the glyph rst + i of font. If a glyph is not de ned, then an
empty display list is constructed for it. The width, height, xorig, and
yorig of the constructed bitmap are computed from the font metrics
as rbearing-lbearing, ascent+descent, -lbearing, and descent-1
respectively. xmove is taken from the width metric and ymove is set to
zero.

Note that in the direct rendering case, this requires that the bitmaps
be copied to the client's address space.

glXUseXFont performs an implicit glFlush().

glXUseXFont is ignored if there is no current GLX rendering
context. BadFont is generated        if font is not a valid X font id.
GLXBadContextState is generated     if the current GLX rendering context
is in display list construction mode. GLXBadCurrentWindow is generated
if the drawable associated with the calling thread's current context is a
window and is no longer valid.

3.2.8 GLX Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following functions are available only if the GLX version is 1.1 or
later.

.. code:: cpp

  const char* glXQueryExtensionsString(Display *dpy, int screen);

glXQueryExtensionsString returns a pointer to a string describing
which GLX extensions are supported on the connection. The string is
zero-terminated and contains a space-seperated list of extension names.
The extension names themselves do not contain spaces. If there are no
extensions to GLX, then the empty string is returned.

.. code:: cpp

  const char* glXGetClientString(Display *dpy, int name);

glXGetClientString returns a pointer to a static, zero-terminated
string describing some aspect of the client library. The possible values
for name are GLX VENDOR, GLX VERSION, and GLX EXTENSIONS. If name
is not set to one of these values then NULL is returned. The format
and contents of the vendor string is implementation dependent, and the
format of the extension string is the same as for glXQueryExtensionsString.
The version string is laid out as follows:

.. code:: text

  <major version.minor version><space><vendor-specific info>

Both the major and minor portions of the version number are of arbitrary
length. The vendor-specific information is optional. However, if it is
present, the format and contents are implementation specific.

.. code:: cpp

  const char* glXQueryServerString(Display *dpy, int screen, int name);

glXQueryServerString returns a pointer to a static, zeroterminated
string describing some aspect of the server's GLX extension.
The possible values for name and the format of the strings is the same
as for glXGetClientString. If name is not set to a recognized value
then NULL is returned.

4 Encoding on the X Byte Stream
========================================================

In the remote rendering case, the overhead associated with interpreting
the GLX extension requests must be minimized. For this reason, all
commands have been broken up into two categories: OpenGL and GLX
commands that are each implemented as a single X extension request
and OpenGL rendering requests that are batched within a GLXRender
request.

4.1 Requests that hold a single extension request
--------------------------------------------------------

Each of the commands from glx.h (that is, the glX* commands) is encoded
by a separate X extension request. In addition, there is a separate
X extension request for each of the OpenGL commands that cannot be
put into a display list. That list consists of all the glGet* commands
plus

- glAreTexturesResident
- glDeleteLists
- glDeleteTextures
- glEndList
- glFeedbackBu er
- glFinish
- glFlush
- glGenLists
- glGenTextures
- glIsEnabled
- glIsList
- glIsTexture
- glNewList
- glPixelStoref
- glPixelStorei
- glReadPixels
- glRenderMode
- glSelectBu er

.. image:: images/glx/1.2-figure-2.png

Figure 2. GLX byte stream.

The two PixelStore commands (glPixelStorei and glPixelStoref) are
exceptions. These commands are issued to the server only to allow it to
set its error state appropriately. Pixel storage state is maintained entirely
on the client side. When pixel data is transmitted to the server (by glDrawPixels,
for example), the pixel storage information that describes
it is transmitted as part of the same protocol request. Implementations
may not change this behavior, because such changes would cause shared
contexts to behave incorrectly.

4.2 Request that holds multiple OpenGL commands
--------------------------------------------------------

The remaining OpenGL commands are those that may be put into display
lists. Multiple occurrences of these commands are grouped together
into a single X extension request (GLXRender). This is diagrammed
in Figure 2.

The grouping minimizes dispatching within the X server. The library
packs as many OpenGL commands as possible into a single X request
(without exceeding the maximum size limit). No OpenGL command
may be split across multiple GLXRender requests.

For long OpenGL commands (those longer than a maximum X request
size), a series of GLXRenderLarge commands is issued. The
structure of the OpenGL command within GLXRenderLarge is the
same as for GLXRender.

Note that it is legal to have a glBegin in one request, followed by
glVertex commands, and eventually the matching glEnd in a subsequent
request. A command is not the same as an OpenGL primitive.

4.3 Wire representations and byte swapping
--------------------------------------------------------

Unsigned and signed integers are represented as they are represented in
the core X protocol. Single and double precision oating point numbers
are sent and received in IEEE oating point format. The X byte stream
and network specifications make it impossible for the client to assure
that double precision oating point numbers will be naturally aligned
within the transport buffers of the server. For those architectures that
require it, the server or client must copy those oating point numbers to
a properly aligned buffer before using them.

Byte swapping on the encapsulated OpenGL byte stream is performed
by the server using the same rule as the core X protocol. Single
precision oating point values are swapped in the same way that 32-bit
integers are swapped. Double precision oating point values are swapped
across all 8 bytes.

4.4 Sequentiality
--------------------------------------------------------

There are two sequences of commands: the X stream, and the OpenGL
stream. In general these two streams are independent: Although the
commands in each stream will be processed in sequence, there is no
guarantee that commands in the separate streams will be processed in
the order in which they were issued by the calling thread.

An exception to this rule arises when a single command appears in
both streams. This forces the two streams to rendezvous.

Because the processing of the two streams may take place at di erent
rates, and some operations may depend on the results of commands in a
di erent stream, we distinguish between commands assigned to each of
the X and OpenGL streams.

The following commands are processed on the client side and therefore
do not exist in either the X or the OpenGL stream:

- glXGetClientString
- glXGetCurrentContext
- glXGetCurrentDisplay
- glXGetCurrentDrawable
- glXGetConfig

The following commands are in the X stream and obey the sequentiality
guarantees for X requests:

- glXCreateContext
- glXDestroyContext
- glXMakeCurrent
- glXIsDirect
- glXQueryExtensionsString
- glXQueryServerString
- glXQueryVersion
- glXWaitGL
- glXCreateGLXPixmap
- glXDestroyGLXPixmap
- glXChooseVisual
- glXSwapBuffers (but see below)
- glXCopyContext (see below)

glXSwapBuffers is in the X stream if and only if the display and
drawable are not those belonging to the calling thread's current context;
otherwise it is in the OpenGL stream. glXCopyContext is in the X
stream alone if and only if its source context di ers from the calling
thread's current context; otherwise it is in both streams.

Commands in the OpenGL stream, which obey the sequentiality
guarantees for OpenGL requests are:

- glXWaitX
- glXSwapBuffers (see below)
- All OpenGL Commands

glXSwapBuffers is in the OpenGL stream if and only if the display
and drawable are those belonging to the calling thread's current context;
otherwise it is in the X stream.

Commands in both streams, which force a rendezvous are:

- glXCopyContext (see below)
- glXUseXFont

glXCopyContext is in both streams if and only if the source context
is the same as the current context of the calling thread; otherwise it is
in the X stream only.

5 Extending OpenGL
========================================================

OpenGL is extended by adding new GLX requests, OpenGL requests or
additional enumerated values to the OpenGL requests. The OpenGL Architectural
Review Board maintains a registry of indexes for each vendor
to use as they wish.

New names must clearly indicate to clients whether some particular
feature is in the core OpenGL or is vendor specific. To make
a vendor-specific name, append a company identi er (in upper case)
and any additional vendor-specific tags (e.g. machine names). For instance,
SGI might add new commands and manifest constants of the
form glNewCommandSGI and GL NEW DEFINITION SGI. If
SGI wanted to provide extensions that were specific to its Reality Engine,
then the names might be of the form glNewCommandSGIre and
GL NEW DEFINITION SGI RE. If two or more licensees agree in
good faith to implement the same extension, and to make the specification
of that extension publicly available, the procedures and tokens that
are de ned by the extension can be su xed by EXT.

6 Glossary
========================================================

Address Space
  the set of objects or memory locations accessible
  through a single name space. In other words, it is a data region
  that one or more processes may share through pointers.

Client
  an X client. An application communicates to a server by some
  path. The application program is referred to as a client of the window
  system server. To the server, the client is the communication
  path itself. A program with multiple connections is viewed as multiple
  clients to the server. The resource lifetimes are controlled by
  the connection lifetimes, not the application program lifetimes.

Connection
  a bidirectional byte stream that carries the X (and GLX)
  protocol between the client and the server. A client typically has
  only one connection to a server.

(Rendering) Context
  a OpenGL rendering context. This is a virtual
  OpenGL machine. All OpenGL rendering is done with respect to
  a context. The state maintained by one rendering context is not
  a ected by another except in case of shared display lists.

GLXContext
  a handle to a rendering context. Rendering contexts
  consist of client side state and server side state.

Similar
  a potential correspondence among GLXDrawables and rendering
  contexts. Windows and GLXPixmaps are similar to a rendering
  context are similar if, and only if, they have been created with
  respect to the same VisualID and root window.

Thread
  one of a group of processes all sharing the same address space.
  Typically, each thread will have its own program counter and stack
  pointer, but the text and data spaces are visible to each of the
  threads. A thread that is the only member of its group is equivalent
  to a process.
