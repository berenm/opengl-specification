1 Introduction

        This document specifies only version 3.0 of the OpenGL ES Shading Language. It requires
        __VERSION__ to substitute 300, and requires #version to accept only 300 es. If #version is declared
        with a smaller number, the language accepted is a previous version of the shading language, which will be
        supported depending on the version and type of context in the OpenGL ES API. See the OpenGL ES
        Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0, for details on what language versions are supported.

1.2   Overview
      This document describes The OpenGL ES Shading Language, version 3.00
      Independent compilation units written in this language are called shaders. A program is a complete set of
      shaders that are compiled and linked together. The aim of this document is to thoroughly specify the
      programming language. The OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification will specify the OpenGL ES
      entry points used to manipulate and communicate with programs and shaders.

1.3   Error Handling
      Compilers, in general, accept programs that are ill-formed, due to the impossibility of detecting all ill-
      formed programs. Portability is only ensured for well-formed programs, which this specification
      describes. Compilers are encouraged to detect ill-formed programs and issue diagnostic messages, but are
      not required to do so for all cases. The compilation process is implementation-dependent but is generally
      split into a number of stages, each of which occurs at one of the following times:
          â¢    A call to glCompileShader
          â¢    A call to glLinkProgram
          â¢    A draw call or a call to glValidateProgram
      The implementation should report errors as early a possible but in any case must satisfy the following:
          â¢    All lexical, grammatical and semantic errors must have been detected following a call to
               glLinkProgram
          â¢    Errors due to mismatch between the vertex and fragment shader (link errors) must have been
               detected following a call to glLinkProgram
          â¢    Errors due to exceeding resource limits must have been detected following any draw call or a call
               to glValidateProgram
          â¢    A call to glValidateProgram must report all errors associated with a program object given the
               current GL state.
      Where the specification uses the terms required, must/must not, does/does not, disallowed or not
      supported, the compiler or linker is required to detect and report any violations. Similarly when a
      condition or situation is an error, it must be reported. Use of any feature marked as reserved is an error.
      Where the specification uses the terms should/should not or undefined behavior there is no such
      requirement but compilers are encouraged to report possible violations.




                                                      4
                                                                                                1 Introduction



      A distinction is made between undefined behavior and an undefined value (or result). Undefined
      behavior includes system instability and/or termination of the application. It is expected that systems will
      be designed to handle these cases gracefully but specification of this is outside the scope of OpenGL ES.
      If a value or result is undefined, the system may behave as if the value or result had been assigned a
      random value. For example, an undefined gl_Position may cause a triangle to be drawn with a random
      size and position. The value may not be consistent. For example an undefined boolean value may cause
      both sub-statements in an if-then-else statement to be executed (see section 4.6.4 Invariance of Undefined
      Values). The implementation may also detect the generation and/or use of undefined values and behave
      accordingly (for example causing a trap). Undefined values must not by themselves cause system
      instability. However undefined values may lead to other more serious conditions such as infinite loops or
      out of bounds array accesses.
      Implementations may not in general support functionality beyond the mandated parts of the specification
      without use of the relevant extension. The only exceptions are:
          1.   If a feature is marked as optional.
          2.   Where a maximum values is stated (e.g. the maximum number of vertex outputs), the
               implementation may support a higher value than that specified.
      Where the implementation supports more than the mandated specification, off-target compilers are
      encouraged to issue warnings if these features are used.
      The compilation process is split between the compiler and linker. The allocation of tasks between the
      compiler and linker is implementation dependent. Consequently there are many errors which may be
      detected either at compiler or link time, depending on the implementation.

1.4   Typographical Conventions
      Italic, bold, and font choices have been used in this specification primarily to improve readability. Code
      fragments use a fixed width font. Identifiers embedded in text are italicized. Keywords embedded in text
      are bold. Operators are called by their name, followed by their symbol in bold in parentheses. The
      clarifying grammar fragments in the text use bold for literals and italics for non-terminals. The official
      grammar in section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ uses all capitals for terminals and lower case for
      non-terminals.

1.5   Compatibility
      The OpenGL ES 3.0 API is designed to work with both GLSL ES v1.00 and GLSL ES 3.00. In general a
      shader written for OpenGL ES 2.0 should work without modification in OpenGL ES 3.0.
      When porting applications from OpenGL ES 2.0 to OpenGL ES 3.0, the following points should be noted:
          â¢    Not all language constructs present in v1.00 of the language are available in v3.00 e.g. attribute
               and varying qualifiers. However, the functionality of GLSL ES 3.00 is a super-set of GLSL ES
               1.00.
          â¢    Some features of the OpenGL ES 3.0 API require language features that are present in GLSL ES
               3.00 but not present in GLSL ES 1.00.

                                                                                       1 Introduction



â¢   It is an error to link a vertex shader and a fragment shader if they are written in different versions
    of the language.
â¢   The OpenGL ES 2.0 API does not support shaders written in GLSL ES 3.0.
â¢   Using GLSL ES 1.00 shaders within OpenGL ES 3.0 may extend the resources available beyond
    the minima specified in GLSL ES 1.0. Shaders which make use of this will not necessarily run
    on an OpenGL ES 2.0 implementation:
    Uniforms
    The number of uniforms specified by gl_MaxVertexUniformVectors and returned by the
    corresponding API query is the same for GLSL ES versions 1.00 and 3.00 when used as part of
    OpenGL ES 3.0.
    Varyings, vertex outputs and fragment inputs
    These are specified differently in the two versions of the language and may be different. For
    GLSL ES 1.00, the maximum number of varyings is specified by gl_MaxVaryingVectors. For
    GLSL ES 3.00, the maximum number of vertex outputs and fragment inputs is independently
    specified by gl_MaxVertexOutputVectors and gl_MaxFragmentInputVectors.
    In GLSL ES 1.00, only varyings which are statically used in both the vertex and fragment
    shaders are counted. This applies when GLSL ES 1.00 is used in OpenGL ES 3.0
    Multiple Render Targets
    Although gl_FragData is declared as an array in GLSL ES 1.00, multiple render targets are not
    supported in OpenGL ES 2.0 and are therefore not available when using GLSL ES 1.00 in
    OpenGL ES 3.0.
â¢   Support of line continuation and support of UTF-8 characters within comments is optional in
    GLSL ES 1.00 when used with the OpenGL ES 2.0 API. However, support is mandated for both
    of these when a GLSL ES 1.00 shader is used with the OpenGL ES 3.0 API.

2 Overview of OpenGL ES Shading

      The OpenGL ES Shading Language is actually two closely related languages. These languages are used
      to create shaders for each of the programmable processors contained in the OpenGL ES processing
      pipeline. Currently, these processors are the vertex and fragment processors.
      Unless otherwise noted in this paper, a language feature applies to all languages, and common usage will
      refer to these languages as a single language. The specific languages will be referred to by the name of
      the processor they target: vertex or fragment.
      Most OpenGL ES state is not tracked or made available to shaders. Typically, user-defined variables will
      be used for communicating between different stages of the OpenGL ES pipeline. However, a small
      amount of state is still tracked and automatically made available to shaders, and there are a few built-in
      variables for interfaces between different stages of the OpenGL ES pipeline.

2.1   Vertex Processor
      The vertex processor is a programmable unit that operates on incoming vertices and their associated data.
      Compilation units written in the OpenGL ES Shading Language to run on this processor are called vertex
      shaders.
      The vertex processor operates on one vertex at a time. It does not replace graphics operations that require
      knowledge of several vertices at a time.

2.2   Fragment Processor
      The fragment processor is a programmable unit that operates on fragment values and their associated
      data. Compilation units written in the OpenGL ES Shading Language to run on this processor are called
      fragment shaders.
      A fragment shader cannot change a fragment's (x, y) position. Access to neighboring fragments is not
      allowed. The values computed by the fragment shader are ultimately used to update framebuffer memory
      or texture memory, depending on the current OpenGL ES state and the OpenGL ES command that caused
      the fragments to be generated.

2.3   Executable
      A single vertex shader and a single fragment shader are compiled and then linked together to form an
      executable. OpenGL ES 3.0 does not support multiple compilation units per stage.

3 Basics

3.1   Character Set
      The source character set used for the OpenGL ES shading languages is a subset of UTF-8. It comprises
      the following characters:
            The letters a-z, A-Z, and the underscore ( _ ).
            The numbers 0-9.
            The symbols period (.), plus (+), dash (-), slash (/), asterisk (*), percent (%), angled brackets (< and
            >), square brackets ( [ and ] ), parentheses ( ( and ) ), braces ( { and } ), caret (^), vertical bar ( | ),
            ampersand (&), tilde (~), equals (=), exclamation point (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), comma (,), and
            question mark (?).
            The number sign (#) for preprocessor use.
            Backslash ('\'), used to indicate line continuation when immediately preceding a new-line.
            White space: the space character, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, carriage-return, and line-
            feed.
      There are no digraphs or trigraphs. There are no escape sequences or other uses of the backslash beyond
      use as the line-continuation character.
      Lines are relevant for compiler diagnostic messages and the preprocessor. They are terminated by
      carriage-return or line-feed. If both are used together, it will count as only a single line termination. For
      the remainder of this document, any of these combinations is simply referred to as a new-line. Lines may
      be of arbitrary length.
      In general, the languageâs use of this character set is case sensitive.
      There are no character or string data types, so no quoting characters are included.
      There is no end-of-file character.
      Inside comments, the character set is extended to allow any byte values to be used but with the exception
      that a byte with the value zero is always interpreted as the end of the string. The character encoding is
      assumed to be UTF-8 but no checking is performed for invalid characters.

3.2   Source Strings
      The source for a single shader is an array of strings of characters from the character set. A single shader
      is made from the concatenation of these strings. Each string can contain multiple lines, separated by new-
      lines. No new-lines need be present in a string; a single line can be formed from multiple strings. No
      new-lines or other characters are inserted by the implementation when it concatenates the strings to form a
      single shader.




                                                        8
                                                                                                       3 Basics



      Diagnostic messages returned from compiling a shader must identify both the line number within a string
      and which source string the message applies to. Source strings are counted sequentially with the first
      string being string 0. Line numbers are one more than the number of new-lines that have been processed,
      including counting the new lines that will be removed by the line-continuation character ( \ ).
      Lines separated by the line-continuation character preceding a new line are concatenated together before
      either comment processing or preprocessing. This means that no white space is substituted for the line-
      continuation character. That is, a single token could be formed by the concatenation by taking the
      characters at the end of one line concatenating them with the characters at the beginning of the next line.
         float f\
         oo;
         // forms a single line equivalent to âfloat foo;â
         // (assuming '\' is the last character before the new line and âooâ are
         // the first two characters of the next line)


3.3   Version Declaration
      Shaders must declare the version of the language they are written to. The version is specified in the first
      line of a shader by a character string:
         #version number es

      where number must be a version of the language, following the same convention as __VERSION__ above.
      The directive â#version 300 esâ is required in any shader that uses version 3.00 of the language. Any
      number representing a version of the language a compiler does not support will cause an error to be
      generated. Version 1.00 of the language does not require shaders to include this directive, and shaders
      that do not include a #version directive will be treated as targeting version 1.00.
      Shaders declaring version 3.00 of the shading language cannot be linked with shaders declaring version
      1.00.
      The #version directive must be present in the first line of a shader and must be followed by a newline. It
      may contain optional white-space as specified below but no other characters are allowed. The directive is
      only permitted in the first line of a shader.
      Processing of the #version directive occurs before all other preprocessing, including line concatenation
      and comment processing.
      version-declaration:
        whitespaceopt POUND whitespaceopt VERSION whitespace number whitespace ES whitespaceopt
      Tokens:
        POUND           #
        VERSION         version
        ES              es




                                                      9
                                                                                                         3 Basics



3.4   Preprocessor
      There is a preprocessor that processes the source strings as part of the compilation process.
      The complete list of preprocessor directives is as follows.
         #
         #define
         #undef

         #if
         #ifdef
         #ifndef
         #else
         #elif
         #endif

         #error
         #pragma

         #extension

         #line

      The following operator is also available
         defined

      Note that the version directive is not considered to be a preprocessor directive and so is not listed here.

      Each number sign (#) can be preceded in its line only by spaces or horizontal tabs. It may also be
      followed by spaces and horizontal tabs, preceding the directive. Each directive is terminated by a new-
      line. Preprocessing does not change the number or relative location of new-lines in a source string.
      The number sign (#) on a line by itself is ignored. Any directive not listed above will cause a diagnostic
      message and make the implementation treat the shader as ill-formed.
      #define and #undef functionality are defined as is standard for C++ preprocessors for macro definitions
      both with and without macro parameters.
      The following predefined macros are available
         __LINE__
         __FILE__
         __VERSION__
         GL_ES

      __LINE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that is one more than the number of preceding new-
      lines in the current source string.
      __FILE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that says which source string number is currently
      being processed.




                                                      10
                                                                                                   3 Basics



__VERSION__ will substitute a decimal integer reflecting the version number of the OpenGL ES shading
language. The version of the shading language described in this document will have __VERSION__
substitute the decimal integer 300.
GL_ES will be defined and set to 1. This is not true for the non-ES OpenGL Shading Language, so it can
be used to do a compile time test to determine if a shader is running on an ES system.
All macro names containing two consecutive underscores ( __ ) are reserved for future use as predefined
macro names. All macro names prefixed with âGL_â (âGLâ followed by a single underscore) are also
reserved.
It is an error to undefine or to redefine a built-in (pre-defined) macro name.
The maximum length of a macro name is 1024 characters. It is an error to declare a name with a length
greater than this.
#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif are defined to operate as for C++ except for the following:
    â¢     Expressions following #if and #elif are restricted to expressions operating on literal integer
          constants, plus identifiers consumed by the defined operator.
    â¢     Undefined identifiers not consumed by the defined operator do not default to '0'. Use of such
          identifiers causes an error.
    â¢     Character constants are not supported.
As in C++, a macro name defined with an empty replacement list does not default to '0' when used in a
preprocessor expression.
The operators available are as follows:

        Precedence Operator class                              Operators               Associativity
         1 (highest)   parenthetical grouping                     ()                   NA
         2             unary                                      defined              Right to Left
                                                                  + - ~ !
         3             multiplicative                             * / %                Left to Right
         4             additive                                   + -                  Left to Right
         5             bit-wise shift                             <<        >>         Left to Right
         6             relational                                 <     >    <= >=     Left to Right
         7             equality                                   == !=                Left to Right
         8             bit-wise and                               &                    Left to Right
         9             bit-wise exclusive or                      ^                    Left to Right
        10             bit-wise inclusive or                      |                    Left to Right
        11             logical and                                &&                   Left to Right
        12 (lowest)    logical inclusive or                       ||                   Left to Right




                                                11
                                                                                                     3 Basics



The defined operator can be used in either of the following ways:
   defined identifier
   defined ( identifier )

 There are no number sign based operators (e.g. no # or #@), no ## operator, nor is there a sizeof
operator.
The semantics of applying operators in the preprocessor match those standard in the C++ preprocessor
with the following exceptions:
    â¢    The 2nd operand in a logical and ('&&') operation is evaluated if and only if the 1st operand
         evaluates to non-zero.
    â¢    The 2nd operand in a logical or ('||') operation is evaluated if and only if the 1 st operand evaluates
         to zero.
If an operand is not evaluated, the presence of undefined identifiers in the operand will not cause an error.
Preprocessor expressions will be evaluated at compile time.
#error will cause the implementation to put a diagnostic message into the shader objectâs information log
(see section 6.1.12 âShader and Program Queriesâ in the OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification for
how to access a shader objectâs information log). The message will be the tokens following the #error
directive, up to the first new-line. The implementation must then consider the shader to be ill-formed.
#pragma allows implementation dependent compiler control. Tokens following #pragma are not subject
to preprocessor macro expansion. If an implementation does not recognize the tokens following
#pragma, then it will ignore that pragma. The following pragmas are defined as part of the language.
   #pragma STDGL

The STDGL pragma is used to reserve pragmas for use by this and future revisions of the language. No
implementation may use a pragma whose first token is STDGL.
   #pragma optimize(on)
   #pragma optimize(off)

can be used to turn off optimizations as an aid in developing and debugging shaders. It can only be used
outside function definitions. By default, optimization is turned on for all shaders. The debug pragma
   #pragma debug(on)
   #pragma debug(off)

can be used to enable compiling and annotating a shader with debug information, so that it can be used
with a debugger. It can only be used outside function definitions. By default, debug is turned off.
The scope as well as the effect of the optimize and debug pragmas is implementation-dependent except
that their use must not generate an error.




                                                 12
                                                                                                  3 Basics



By default, compilers of this language must issue compile time syntactic, grammatical, and semantic
errors for shaders that do not conform to this specification. Any extended behavior must first be enabled.
Directives to control the behavior of the compiler with respect to extensions are declared with the
#extension directive
   #extension extension_name : behavior
   #extension all : behavior

where extension_name is the name of an extension. Extension names are not documented in this
specification. The token all means the behavior applies to all extensions supported by the compiler. The
behavior can be one of the following:

 behavior                  Effect
         require           Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Give an error on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not
                           supported, or if all is specified.


         enable            Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.
                           Give an error on the #extension if all is specified.


          warn             Behave as specified by the extension extension_name, except issue warnings
                           on any detectable use of that extension, unless such use is supported by other
                           enabled or required extensions.
                           If all is specified, then warn on all detectable uses of any extension used.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.


         disable           Behave (including issuing errors and warnings) as if the extension
                           extension_name is not part of the language definition.
                           If all is specified, then behavior must revert back to that of the non-extended
                           core version of the language being compiled to.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.



The extension directive is a simple, low-level mechanism to set the behavior for each extension. It does
not define policies such as which combinations are appropriate, those must be defined elsewhere. Order
of directives matters in setting the behavior for each extension: Directives that occur later override those
seen earlier. The all variant sets the behavior for all extensions, overriding all previously issued
extension directives, but only for the behaviors warn and disable.

                                                                                                        3 Basics



      The initial state of the compiler is as if the directive
         #extension all : disable

      was issued, telling the compiler that all error and warning reporting must be done according to this
      specification, ignoring any extensions.
      Each extension can define its allowed granularity of scope. If nothing is said, the granularity is a shader
      (that is, a single compilation unit), and the extension directives must occur before any non-preprocessor
      tokens. If necessary, the linker can enforce granularities larger than a single compilation unit, in which
      case each involved shader will have to contain the necessary extension directive.
      Macro expansion is not done on lines containing #extension and #version directives.
      For each extension there is an associated macro. The macro is always defined in an implementation that
      supports the extension. This allows the following construct to be used:
         #ifdef OES_extension_name
                #extension OES_extension_name : enable
                // code that requires the extension
         #else
                // alternative code
         #endif

      #line must have, after macro substitution, one of the following forms:
         #line line
         #line line source-string-number

      where line and source-string-number are constant integral expressions. After processing this directive
      (including its new-line), the implementation will behave as if it is compiling at line number line and
      source string number source-string-number. Subsequent source strings will be numbered sequentially,
      until another #line directive overrides that numbering.
      If during macro expansion a preprocessor directive is encountered, the results are undefined; the compiler
      may or may not report an error in such cases.

3.5   Comments
      Comments are delimited by /* and */, or by // and a new-line. The begin comment delimiters (/* or //) are
      not recognized as comment delimiters inside of a comment, hence comments cannot be nested. If a
      comment resides entirely within a single line, it is treated syntactically as a single space. New-lines are
      not eliminated by comments.

3.6   Tokens

          token:
               keyword
               identifier
               integer-constant

        In addition, all identifiers containing two consecutive underscores (__) are reserved as possible future
        keywords.

3.8     Identifiers
        Identifiers are used for variable names, function names, structure names, and field selectors (field
        selectors select components of vectors and matrices similar to structure fields, as discussed in section 5.5
        âVector Componentsâ and section 5.6 âMatrix Componentsâ ). Identifiers have the form

             identifier
                  nondigit
                  identifier nondigit
                  identifier digit
             nondigit: one of
                 _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
                 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
             digit: one of
                   0123456789


        Identifiers starting with âgl_â are reserved for use by OpenGL ES, and may not be declared in a shader as
        either a variable or a function. It is an error to redeclare a variable, including those starting âgl_â.
        The maximum length of an identifier is 1024 characters. It is an error to declare a variable with a length
        greater than this.

3.9     Definitions
        Some language rules described below depend on the following definitions.

3.9.1   Static Use
        A shader contains a static use of (or static assignment to) a variable x if, after preprocessing, the shader
        contains a statement that would read (or write) x, whether or not run-time flow of control will cause that
        statement to be executed.




                                                        17
                                                                                                          3 Basics



3.9.2   Uniform and Non-Uniform Control Flow
        When executing statements in a fragment shader, control flow starts as uniform control flow; all fragments
        enter the same control path into main(). Control flow becomes non-uniform when different fragments
        take different paths through control-flow statements (selection, iteration, and jumps). Control flow
        subsequently returns to being uniform after such divergent sub-statements or skipped code completes,
        until the next time different control paths are taken.
        For example:
           main()
           {
               float a = ...;//         this is uniform control flow
               if (a < b) { //          this expression is true for some fragments, not all
                   ....;     //         non-uniform control flow
               } else {
                   ....;     //         non-uniform control flow
               }
               ....;         //         uniform control flow again
           }

        Other examples of non-uniform control flow can occur within switch statements and after conditional
        breaks, continues, early returns, and after fragment discards, when the condition is true for some
        fragments but not others. Loop iterations that only some fragments execute are also non-uniform control
        flow.
        This is similarly defined for other shader stages, based on the per-instance data items they process.

3.9.3   Dynamically Uniform Expressions
        A fragment-shader expression is dynamically uniform if all fragments evaluating it get the same resulting
        value. When loops are involved, this refers to the expression's value for the same loop iteration. When
        functions are involved, this refers to calls from the same call point.
        This is similarly defined for other shader stages, based on the per-instance data they process.
        Note that constant expressions are trivially dynamically uniform. It follows that typical loop counters
        based on these are also dynamically uniform.
        The definition is not used in this version of GLSL ES but may be referenced by extensions.

3.10    Logical Phases of Compilation
        The compilation process is based on a subset of the C++ standard (see section 14: Normative References).
        The compilation units for the vertex and fragment processor are processed separately before being linked
        together in the final stage of compilation. The logical phases of compilation are:
            1.   Source strings are concatenated.
            2.   The source string is converted into a sequence of preprocessing tokens. These tokens include
                 preprocessing numbers, identifiers and preprocessing operations. Comments are each replaced
                 by one space character. Line breaks are retained.

                                                                                          3 Basics



3.   The preprocessor is run. Directives are executed and macro expansion is performed.
4.   Preprocessing tokens are converted into tokens.
5.   White space and line breaks are discarded.
6.   The syntax is analyzed according to the GLSL ES grammar.
7.   The result is checked according to the semantic rules of the language.
8.   The vertex and fragment shaders are linked together. Any vertex outputs and corresponding
     fragment inputs not used in both the vertex and fragment shaders may be discarded.
9.   The binary is generated.

4 Variables and Types

      All variables and functions must be declared before being used. Variable and function names are
      identifiers.
      There are no default types. All variable and function declarations must have a declared type, and
      optionally qualifiers. A variable is declared by specifying its type followed by one or more names
      separated by commas. In many cases, a variable can be initialized as part of its declaration by using the
      assignment operator (=). The grammar near the end of this document provides a full reference for the
      syntax of declaring variables.
      User-defined types may be defined using struct to aggregate a list of existing types into a single name.
      The OpenGL ES Shading Language is type safe. There are no implicit conversions between types.

4.1   Basic Types
      The OpenGL ES Shading Language supports the following basic data types, grouped as follows.

           uint                         an unsigned integer

        Unsigned Integer Sampler Types (opaque)

             Type                          Meaning
             usampler2D                    a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 2D texture

             usampler2DArray               a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 2D array texture

        In addition, a shader can aggregate these using arrays and structures to build more complex types.
        There are no pointer types.

4.1.1   Void
        Functions that do not return a value must be declared as void. There is no default function return type.
        The keyword void cannot be used in any other declarations (except for empty formal or actual parameter
        lists).

4.1.2   Booleans
        To make conditional execution of code easier to express, the type bool is supported. There is no
        expectation that hardware directly supports variables of this type. It is a genuine Boolean type, holding
        only one of two values meaning either true or false. Two keywords true and false can be used as literal
        Boolean constants. Booleans are declared and optionally initialized as in the follow example:
           bool success;      // declare âsuccessâ to be a Boolean
           bool done = false; // declare and initialize âdoneâ

        The right side of the assignment operator ( = ) must be an expression whose type is bool.
        Expressions used for conditional jumps (if, for, ?:, while, do-while) must evaluate to the type bool.

4.1.3   Integers
        Signed and unsigned integer variables are fully supported. In this document, the term integer is meant to
        generally include both signed and unsigned integers. Highp unsigned integers have exactly 32 bits of
        precision. Highp signed integers use 32 bits, including a sign bit, in two's complement form. Mediump
        and lowp integers have implementation-defined numbers of bits. Operations resulting in overflow or
        underflow will not cause any exception, nor will they saturate, rather they will âwrapâ to yield the low-
        order n bits of the result where n is the size in bits of the integer. See section 4.5.1 âRange and Precisionâ
        for details.
        Integers are declared and optionally initialized with integer expressions, as in the following example:
           int i, j = 42;         // default integer literal type is int
           uint k = 3u;           // âuâ establishes the type as uint

                                                                                4 Variables and Types



Literal integer constants can be expressed in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16)
as follows.

     integer-constant:
          decimal-constant integer-suffixopt
          octal-constant integer-suffixopt
          hexadecimal-constant integer-suffixopt
     integer-suffix: one of
          u U
     decimal-constant:
         nonzero-digit
         decimal-constant digit
     octal-constant:
          0
          octal-constant octal-digit
     hexadecimal-constant:
         0x hexadecimal-digit
         0X hexadecimal-digit
         hexadecimal-constant hexadecimal-digit
     digit:
           0
           nonzero-digit
     nonzero-digit: one of
         123456789
     octal-digit : one of
          01234567
     hexadecimal-digit: one of
         0123456789
         abcdef
         ABCDEF
No white space is allowed between the digits of an integer constant, including after the leading 0 or after
the leading 0x or 0X of a constant, or before the suffix u or U. When the suffix u or U is present, the
literal has type uint, otherwise the type is int. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted as an
arithmetic unary negation, not as part of the constant.
It is an error to provide a literal integer whose value would be too large to store in a highp uint variable.
Note that this only applies to literals; no error checking is performed on the result of a constant
expression.

                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Examples
           1                // signed integer, value 1

           1u               // unsigned integer, value 1

           -1               // unary minus applied to signed integer.
                            // result is a signed integer, value -1

           -1u              // unary minus applies to unsigned integer
                            // result is an unsigned integer, value 0xffffffff

           0xffffffff       // signed integer, value -1

           0xffffffffu // unsigned integer, value 0xffffffff

           0xffffffff0 // error: values of signed integer is too large

4.1.4   Floats
        Floats are available for use in a variety of scalar calculations. Floating-point variables are defined as in
        the following example:
           float a, b = 1.5;

        As an input value to one of the processing units, a floating-point variable is expected to match the IEEE
        754 single precision floating-point definition for precision and dynamic range. Highp floating-point
        variables within a shader are encoded according to the IEEE 754 specification for single-precision
        floating-point values (logically, not necessarily physically). While encodings are logically IEEE 754,
        operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) are not necessarily performed as required by IEEE 754. See
        section 4.5.1 âRange and Precisionâ for more details on precision and usage of NaNs (Not a Number) and
        Infs (positive or negative infinities).

                                                                                         4 Variables and Types



        Floating-point constants are defined as follows.

             floating-constant:
                   fractional-constant exponent-partopt floating-suffixopt
                  digit-sequence exponent-part floating-suffixopt
             fractional-constant:
                  digit-sequence . digit-sequence
                  digit-sequence .
                  . digit-sequence
             exponent-part:
                 e signopt digit-sequence
                 E signopt digit-sequence

             sign: one of
                  +â
             digit-sequence:
                   digit
                   digit-sequence digit
             floating-suffix: one of
                   f F
        A decimal point ( . ) is not needed if the exponent part is present. No white space may appear anywhere
        within a floating-point constant, including before a suffix. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted as
        a unary operator and is not part of the floating-point constant.
        There is no limit on the number of digits in any digit-sequence. If the value of the floating point number
        is too large (small) to be stored as a single precision value, it is converted to positive (negative) infinity.
        A value with a magnitude too small to be represented as a mantissa and exponent is converted to zero.
        Implementations may also convert subnormal (denormalized) numbers to zero.

4.1.5   Vectors
        The OpenGL ES Shading Language includes data types for generic 2-, 3-, and 4-component vectors of
        floating-point values, integers, and Booleans. Floating-point vector variables can be used to store colors,
        normals, positions, texture coordinates, texture lookup results and the like. Boolean vectors can be used
        for component-wise comparisons of numeric vectors. Some examples of vector declaration are:
           vec2 texcoord1, texcoord2;
           vec3 position;
           vec4 myRGBA;
           ivec2 textureLookup;
           bvec3 less;

        Initialization of vectors can be done with constructors, which are discussed shortly.




                                                         25
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.6   Matrices
        The OpenGL ES Shading Language has built-in types for 2Ã2, 2Ã3, 2Ã4, 3Ã2, 3Ã3, 3Ã4, 4Ã2, 4Ã3, and
        4Ã4 matrices of floating-point numbers. The first number in the type is the number of columns, the
        second is the number of rows. Example matrix declarations:
           mat2 mat2D;
           mat3 optMatrix;
           mat4 view, projection;
           mat4x4 view; // an alternate way of declaring a mat4
           mat3x2 m;     // a matrix with 3 columns and 2 rows

        Initialization of matrix values is done with constructors (described in section 5.4 âConstructorsâ ) in
        column-major order.
        mat2 is an alias for mat2x2, not a distinct type. Similarly for mat3 and mat4 The following is legal:
           mat2 a;
           mat2x2 b = a;

4.1.7   Samplers
        Sampler types (e.g. sampler2D) are effectively opaque handles to textures and their filters. They are used
        with the built-in texture functions (described in section 8.7 âTexture Lookup Functionsâ ) to specify which
        texture to access and how it is to be filtered. They can only be declared as function parameters or
        uniform variables (see section 4.3.5 âUniformâ). Except for array indexing, structure field selection, and
        parentheses, samplers are not allowed to be operands in expressions. Samplers aggregated into arrays
        within a shader (using square brackets [ ]) can only be indexed with constant integral expressions (see
        section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ). Samplers cannot be treated as l-values; hence cannot be used as
        out or inout function parameters, nor can they be assigned into. As uniforms, they are initialized only
        with the OpenGL ES API; they cannot be declared with an initializer in a shader. As function parameters,
        only samplers may be passed to samplers of matching type. This enables consistency checking between
        shader texture accesses and OpenGL ES texture state before a shader is run.

4.1.8   Structures
        User-defined types can be created by aggregating other already defined types into a structure using the
        struct keyword. For example,
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           } lightVar;

        In this example, light becomes the name of the new type, and lightVar becomes a variable of type light.
        To declare variables of the new type, use its name (without the keyword struct).
           light lightVar2;

        More formally, structures are declared as follows. However, the complete correct grammar is as given in
        section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ .




                                                       26
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



     struct-definition:
          qualifieropt struct nameopt { member-list } declaratorsopt ;

     member-list:
        member-declaration;
        member-declaration member-list;
     member-declaration:
        basic-type declarators;
where name becomes the user-defined type, and can be used to declare variables to be of this new type.
The name shares the same name space as other variables, types, and functions. All previously visible
variables, types, constructors, or functions with that name are hidden. The optional qualifier only applies
to any declarators, and is not part of the type being defined for name.
Structures must have at least one member declaration. Member declarators may contain precision
qualifiers, but may not contain any other qualifiers. Bit fields are not supported. Member types must be
already defined (there are no forward references). Member declarations cannot contain initializers.
Member declarators can contain arrays. Such arrays must have a size specified, and the size must be a
constant integral expression that's greater than zero (see section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ). Each
level of structure has its own name space for names given in member declarators; such names need only
be unique within that name space.
Anonymous structures are not supported. Embedded structure definitions are not supported.
   struct S { float f; }; // Allowed: S is defined as a structure.

   struct T {
          S;              // Error: anonymous structures disallowed
          struct { ... }; // Error: embedded structures disallowed
          S s;            // Allowed: nested structure with a name.
   };

Structures can be initialized at declaration time using constructors, as discussed in section 5.4.3 âStructure
Constructorsâ .
Any restrictions on the usage of a type or qualifier also apply to a structure that contains that type or
qualifier. This applies recursively.




                                                27
                                                                                         4 Variables and Types



4.1.9   Arrays
        Variables of the same type can be aggregated into arrays by declaring a name followed by brackets ( [ ] )
        enclosing a size. The array size must be a constant integral expression (see section 4.3.3 âConstant
        Expressionsâ ) greater than zero. The type of the size parameter can be a signed or unsigned integer and
        the choice of type does not affect the type of the resulting array. It is illegal to index an array with a
        constant integral expression greater than or equal to the declared size. It is also illegal to index an array
        with a negative constant expression. Arrays declared as formal parameters in a function declaration must
        also specify a size. Undefined behavior results from indexing an array with a non-constant expression
        thatâs greater than or equal to the arrayâs size or less than 0. Only one-dimensional arrays may be
        declared. All basic types and structures can be formed into arrays. Some examples are:
           float frequencies[3];
           uniform vec4 lightPosition[4u];

           const int numLights = 2;
           light lights[numLights];

        An array type can be formed by specifying a type followed by square brackets ([ ]) and including a size:
           float[5]

        This type can be used anywhere any other type can be used, including as the return value from a function
           float[5] foo() { }

        as a constructor of an array
           float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1)

        as an unnamed parameter
           void foo(float[5])

        and as an alternate way of declaring a variable or function parameter.
           float[5] a;

        An array type can also be formed without specifying a size if the definition includes an initializer:
           float x[] = float[2] (1.0, 2.0);     // declares an array of size 2
           float y[] = float[] (1.0, 2.0, 3.0); // declares an array of size 3

           float a[5];
           float b[] = a;

        Note that the initializer itself does not need to be a constant expression but the length of the initializer will
        be a constant expression.




                                                         28
                                                                                          4 Variables and Types



        It is an error to declare arrays of arrays:
           float a[5][3];          // illegal
           float[5] a[3];          // illegal


        Arrays can have initializers formed from array constructors:
           float a[5] = float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1);
           float a[5] = float[](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1); // same thing

        An array declaration which leaves the size unspecified is an error.
        Arrays have a fixed number of elements. This can be obtained by using the length method:
           a.length();         // returns 5 for the above declarations

        The return value is a constant signed integral expression. The precision is determined using the same
        rules as for literal integers.

4.2     Scoping
        The scope of a declaration determines where the declaration is visible. GLSL ES uses a system of
        statically nested scopes. This allows names to be redefined within a shader.

4.2.1   Definition of Terms
        The term scope refers to a specified region of the program where names may be defined and are
        guaranteed to be visible. For example, a compound_statement_with_scope ('{' statement statement ... '}')
        defines a scope.
        A nested scope is a scope defined within an outer scope.
        The terms 'same scope' and 'current scope' are equivalent to the term 'scope' but used to emphasize that
        nested scopes are excluded.
        The scope of a declaration is the region or regions of the program where that declaration is visible.

4.2.2   Types of Scope
        The scope of a variable is determined by where it is declared. If it is declared outside all function
        definitions, it has global scope, which starts from where it is declared and persists to the end of the shader
        it is declared in. If it is declared in a while test or a for statement, then it is scoped to the end of the
        following sub-statement (specified as statement-no-new-scope in the grammar). Otherwise, if it is
        declared as a statement within a compound statement, it is scoped to the end of that compound statement.
        If it is declared as a parameter in a function definition, it is scoped until the end of that function definition.
        A function's parameter declarations and body together form a single scope.




                                                         29
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



   int f( /* nested scope begins here */ int k)
   {
         int k = k + 3;        // redeclaration error of the name k
         ...
   }

   int f(int k)
   {
       {
           int k = k + 3; // 2nd k is parameter, initializing nested first k
           int m = k      // use of new k, which is hiding the parameter
       }
   }


For both for and while loops, the sub-statement itself does not introduce a new scope for variable names,
so the following has a redeclaration compile-time error:

   for ( /* nested scope begins here */ int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
   {
       int i; // redeclaration error
   }

The body of a do-while loop introduces a new scope lasting only between the do and while (not including
the while test expression), whether or not the body is simple or compound:
   int i = 17;
   do
       int i = 4;          // okay, in nested scope
   while (i == 0);         // i is 17, scoped outside the do-while body

Representing the if construct as:
         if if-expression then if-statement else else-statement,
a variable declared in the if-statement is scoped to the end of the if-statement. A variable declared in the
else-statement is scoped to the end of the else-statement. This applies both when these statements are
simple statements and when they are compound statements. The if-expression does not allow new
variables to be declared, hence does not form a new scope.




                                                  30
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Within a declaration, the scope of a name starts immediately after the initializer if present or immediately
        after the name being declared if not. Several examples:
           int x = 1;
           {
                  int x = 2,/* 2nd x visible here */ y = x; // y is initialized to 2
                  int z = z;        // error if z not previously defined.
           }
           {
                  int x = x;        // x is initialized to '1'
           }

        A structure name declaration is visible at the end of the struct_specifier in which it was declared:
           struct S
           {
                  int x;
           };

           {
                    S S = S(0);         // 'S' is only visible as a struct and constructor
                    S;                  // 'S' is now visible as a variable
           }

           int x = x;                  // Error if x has not been previously defined.



4.2.3   Redeclaring Names

        All variable names, structure type names, and function names in a given scope share the same name space.
        Function names can be redeclared in the same scope, with the same or different parameters, without error.
        Otherwise, within a shader, a declared name cannot be redeclared in the same scope; doing so results in a
        redeclaration error. If a nested scope redeclares a name used in an outer scope, it hides all existing uses of
        that name. There is no way to access the hidden name or make it unhidden, without exiting the scope that
        hid it.
        Names of built-in functions cannot be redeclared as functions. Therefore overloading or redefining built-
        in functions is an error.




                                                        31
                                                                            4 Variables and Types



A declaration is considered to be a statement that adds a name or signature to the symbol table. A
definition is a statement that fully defines that name or signature. E.g.
     int f();                          //   declaration;
     int f() {return 0;}               //   declaration and definition
     int x;                            //   declaration and definition
     int a[4];                         //   array declaration and definition
     struct S {int x;};                //   structure declaration and definition

The determination of equivalence of two declarations depends on the type of declaration. For functions,
the whole function signature must be considered (see section 6.1 Function Definitions). For variables
(including arrays) and structures only the names must match.
Within each scope, a name may be declared either as a variable declaration or as function declarations or
as a structure.
Examples of combinations that are allowed:
1.
     void f(int) {...}
     void f(float) {...} // function overloading allowed
2.
     void f(int);             // 1st declaration (allowed)
     void f(int);             // repeated declaration (allowed)
     void f(int) {...}        // single definition (allowed)

Examples of combinations that are disallowed:
1.
     void f(int) {...}
     void f(int) {...}        // Error: repeated definition
2.
     void f(int);
     struct f {int x;};       // Error: type 'f' conflicts with function 'f'
3.
     struct f {int x;};
     int f;                   // Error: conflicts with the type 'f'
4.
     int a[3];
     int a[3];                // Error: repeated array definition
5.
     int x;
     int x;                   // Error: repeated variable definition

                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



4.2.4   Global Scope
        The built-in functions are scoped in the global scope users declare global variables in. That is, a shader's
        global scope, available for user-defined functions and global variables, is the same as the scope containing
        the built-in functions. Function declarations (prototypes) cannot occur inside of functions; they must be at
        global scope.,Hence it is not possible to hide a name with a function.

4.2.5   Shared Globals
        Shared globals are variables that can be accessed by multiple compilation units. In GLSL ES the only
        shared globals are uniforms. Vertex shader outputs are not considered to be shared globals since they
        must pass through the rasterization stage before they are used as input by the fragment shader.
        Shared globals share the same name space, and must be declared with the same type and precision. They
        will share the same storage. Shared global arrays must have the same base type and the same explicit size.
        Scalars must have exactly the same precision, type name and type definition. Structures must have the
        same name, sequence of type names, and type definitions, and field names to be considered the same type.
        This rule applies recursively for nested or embedded types.

4.3     Storage Qualifiers
        Variable declarations may have one storage qualifier specified in front of the type. These are summarized
        as

               Qualifier               Meaning
               < none: default >       local read/write memory, or an input parameter to a function
               const                   a compile-time constant, or a function parameter that is read-only
               in                      linkage into a shader from a previous stage, variable is copied in
               centroid in             linkage with centroid based interpolation
               out                     linkage out of a shader to a subsequent stage, variable is copied out
               centroid out            linkage with centroid based interpolation
               uniform                 value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms
                                       form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL ES, and the application


        Outputs from shader (out) and inputs to a shader (in) can be further qualified with one of these
        interpolation qualifiers

               Qualifier                   Meaning
               smooth                      perspective correct interpolation
               flat                        no interpolation


        These interpolation qualifiers may only precede the qualifiers in, centroid in, out, or centroid out in a
        declaration. They do not apply to inputs into a vertex shader or outputs from a fragment shader.
        Local variables can only use the const storage qualifier.




                                                       33
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        Function parameters can use const, in, and out qualifiers, but as parameter qualifiers. Parameter
        qualifiers are discussed in section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.
        Function return types and structure fields do not use storage qualifiers.
        Data types for communication from one run of a shader executable to its next run (to communicate
        between fragments or between vertices) do not exist. This would prevent parallel execution of the same
        shader executable on multiple vertices or fragments.
        Initializers may only be used in declarations of globals with no storage qualifier or with a const qualifier.
        Such initializers must be a constant expression. Global variables without storage qualifiers that are not
        initialized in their declaration or by the application will not be initialized by OpenGL ES, but rather will
        enter main() with undefined values.

4.3.1   Default Storage Qualifier
        If no qualifier is present on a global variable, then the variable has no linkage to the application or shaders
        running on other pipeline stages. For either global or local unqualified variables, the declaration will
        appear to allocate memory associated with the processor it targets. This variable will provide read/write
        access to this allocated memory.

4.3.2   Constant Qualifier
        Named compile-time constants can be declared using the const qualifier. Any variables qualified as
        constant are read-only variables for that shader. Declaring variables as constant allows more descriptive
        shaders than using hard-wired numerical constants. The const qualifier can be used with any of the non-
        void transparent basic data types as well as structures and arrays of these. It is an error to write to a const
        variable outside of its declaration, so they must be initialized when declared. For example,
           const vec3 zAxis = vec3 (0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

        Structure fields may not be qualified with const. Structure variables can be declared as const, and
        initialized with a structure constructor.
        Initializers for const declarations must be constant expressions, as defined in section 4.3.3 âConstant
        Expressions.â




                                                        34
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



4.3.3   Constant Expressions
        A constant expression is one of
        â¢   a literal value (e.g. 5 or true)
        â¢   a global or local variable qualified as const (i.e., not including function parameters)
        â¢   an expression formed by an operator on operands that are all constant expressions, including getting an
            element of a constant array, or a field of a constant structure, or components of a constant vector.
            However, the sequence operator ( , ) and the assignment operators ( =, +=, ...) are not included in the
            operators that can create a constant expression.
        â¢   the length() method on an array, whether or not the object itself is constant.
        â¢   a constructor whose arguments are all constant expressions
        â¢   a built-in function call whose arguments are all constant expressions, with the exception of the texture
            lookup functions. The built-in functions dFdx, dFdy, and fwidth must return 0 when evaluated inside
            an initializer with an argument that is a constant expression.
        Function calls to user-defined functions (non-built-in functions) cannot be used to form constant
        expressions.
        Scalar, vector, matrix, array and structure variables are constant expressions if qualified as const. Sampler
        types cannot be constant expressions.
        A constant integral expression is a constant expression that evaluates to a scalar signed or unsigned
        integer.
        Constant expressions will be evaluated in an invariant way so as to create the same value in multiple
        shaders when the same constant expressions appear in those shaders. See section 4.6.1 âThe Invariant
        Qualifierâ for more details on how to create invariant expressions.

4.3.4   Input Variables
        Shader input variables are declared with the in storage qualifier or the centroid in storage qualifier. They
        form the input interface between previous stages of the OpenGL ES pipeline and the declaring shader.
        Input variables must be declared at global scope. Values from the previous pipeline stage are copied into
        input variables at the beginning of shader execution. Variables declared as in or centroid in may not be
        written to during shader execution. Only the input variables that are actually read need to be written by
        the previous stage; it is allowed to have superfluous declarations of input variables.
        See section 7 âBuilt-in Variablesâ for a list of the built-in input names.
        Vertex shader input variables (or attributes) receive per-vertex data. They are declared in a vertex shader
        with the in qualifier. It is an error to use centroid in or interpolation qualifiers in a vertex shader input.
        The values copied in are established by the OpenGL ES API or through the use of the layout identifier
        location. Vertex shader inputs can only be float, floating-point vectors, matrices, signed and unsigned
        integers and integer vectors. Vertex shader inputs cannot be arrays or structures.




                                                        35
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Example declarations in a vertex shader:
           in vec4 position;
           in vec3 normal;

        It is expected that graphics hardware will have a small number of fixed vector locations for passing vertex
        inputs. Therefore, the OpenGL ES Shading language defines each non-matrix input variable as taking up
        one such vector location. There is an implementation dependent limit on the number of locations that can
        be used, and if this is exceeded it will cause a link error. (Declared input variables that are not statically
        used do not count against this limit.) A scalar input counts the same amount against this limit as a vec4, so
        applications may want to consider packing groups of four unrelated float inputs together into a vector to
        better utilize the capabilities of the underlying hardware. A matrix input will use up multiple locations.
        The number of locations used will equal the number of columns in the matrix.
        Fragment shader inputs get per-fragment values, typically interpolated from a previous stage's outputs.
        They are declared in fragment shaders with the in storage qualifier or the centroid in storage qualifier.
        Fragment inputs can only be signed and unsigned integers and integer vectors, float, floating-point
        vectors, matrices, or arrays or structures of these. Fragment shader inputs that are, or contain, signed or
        unsigned integers or integer vectors must be qualified with the interpolation qualifier flat.
        Fragment inputs are declared as in the following examples:
           in vec3 normal;
           centroid in vec2 TexCoord;


           flat in vec3 myColor;

        The output of the vertex shader and the input of the fragment shader form an interface. For this interface,
        vertex shader output variables and fragment shader input variables of the same name must match in type
        and qualification (other than precision and out matching to in).

4.3.5   Uniform Variables
        The uniform qualifier is used to declare global variables whose values are the same across the entire
        primitive being processed. All uniform variables are read-only. They are initialized to 0 at link time and
        may be updated through the API.
        Example declarations are:
           uniform vec4 lightPosition;

        The uniform qualifier can be used with any of the basic data types, or when declaring a variable whose
        type is a structure, or an array of any of these.
        There is an implementation dependent limit on the amount of storage for uniforms that can be used for
        each type of shader and if this is exceeded it will cause a compile-time or link-time error. Uniform
        variables that are declared but not used do not count against this limit. The number of user-defined
        uniform variables and the number of built-in uniform variables that are used within a shader are added
        together to determine whether available uniform storage has been exceeded.




                                                        36
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



        Uniforms in the vertex and fragment shaders share a single global name space. Hence, the types and
        precisions of uniform variables with the same name must match across shaders that are linked into a single
        program.

4.3.6   Output Variables
        Shader output variables are declared with the out or centroid out storage qualifiers. They form the
        output interface between the declaring shader and the subsequent stages of the OpenGL ES pipeline.
        Output variables must be declared at global scope. During shader execution they will behave as normal
        unqualified global variables. Their values are copied out to the subsequent pipeline stage on shader exit.
        Only output variables that are read by the subsequent pipeline stage need to be written; it is allowed to
        have superfluous declarations of output variables.
        There is not an inout storage qualifier at global scope for declaring a single variable name as both input
        and output to a shader. Output variables must be declared with different names than input variables.
        Vertex output variables output per-vertex data and are declared using the out storage qualifier or the
        centroid out storage qualifier. They can only be float, floating-point vectors, matrices, signed or
        unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays or structures of any these. Vertex shader outputs that are,
        or contain, signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors must be qualified with the interpolation qualifier
        flat.
        Individual vertex outputs are declared as in the following examples:
           out vec3 normal;
           centroid out vec2 TexCoord;
           invariant centroid out vec4 Color;
           flat out vec3 myColor;

        Fragment outputs output per-fragment data and are declared using the out storage qualifier. It is an error
        to use centroid out in a fragment shader. Fragment outputs can only be float, floating-point vectors,
        signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays of any these. Outputs declared as arrays may only
        be indexed by a constant integral expression. Matrices and structures cannot be output. Fragment outputs
        are declared as in the following examples:
           out vec4 FragmentColor;
           out uint Luminosity;




                                                       37
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.3.7   Interface Blocks
        Uniform variable declarations can be grouped into named interface blocks to provide coarser granularity
        backing than is achievable with individual declarations. They can have an optional instance name, used in
        the shader to reference their members. A uniform block is backed by the application with a buffer object.
        GLSL ES 3.0 does not support interface blocks for shader inputs or outputs.
        An interface block is started by a uniform keyword, followed by a block name, followed by an open curly
        brace ( { ) as follows:
             interface-block:
                   layout-qualifieropt uniform block-name { member-list } instance-nameopt ;
             layout-qualifier:
                  layout ( layout-qualifier-id-list )
             layout-qualifier-id-list
                  comma separated list of layout-qualifier-id
             member-list:
                 member-declaration
                 member-declaration member-list
             member-declaration:
                 layout-qualifieropt qualifiersopt type declarators ;
             instance-name:
                   identifier
                   identifier [ constant-integral-expression ]
        Each of the above elements is discussed below, with the exception of layout qualifiers (layout-qualifier),
        which are defined in the next section.
        First, an example,
            uniform Transform {
                mat4 ModelViewMatrix;
                mat4 ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
                uniform mat3 NormalMatrix;                       // allowed restatement of qualifier
                float Deformation;
            };

        The above establishes a uniform block named âTransformâ with four uniforms grouped inside it.
        Types and declarators are the same as for other uniform variable declarations outside blocks, with these
        exceptions:
        â¢   sampler types are not allowed
        â¢   structure definitions cannot be nested inside a block
        Otherwise, built-in types, previously declared structures, and arrays of these are allowed as the type of a
        declarator in the same manner they are allowed outside a block.




                                                        38
                                                                            4 Variables and Types



  Repeating the uniform interface qualifier for a member's storage qualifier is optional. For example,

   uniform Transform
   {
       uniform mat4 model_view; // legal, uniform inside a uniform block.
       mat4 projection;         // legal, 'uniform' inherited from block.
       in bool transform_flag; // illegal, member is not a uniform.
   }

For uniform blocks, the application uses the block name to identify the block. Block names have no other
use within a shader beyond interface matching; it is an error to use a block name at global scope for
anything other than as a block name (e.g., use of a block name for a global variable name or function
name is currently reserved).
Matched block names within an interface (as defined above) must match in terms of having the same
number of declarations with the same sequence of types, precisions and the same sequence of member
names, as well as having the same member-wise layout qualification (see next section). Furthermore, if a
matching block is declared as an array, then the array sizes must also match.
If an instance name (instance-name) is not used, the names declared inside the block are scoped at the
global level and accessed as if they were declared outside the block. If an instance name (instance-name)
is used, then it puts all the members inside a scope within its own name space, accessed with the field
selector ( . ) operator (analogously to structures). For example,
   uniform Transform_1
   {
       mat4 modelview;
   }

   uniform Transform_2
   {
       mat4 projection;
   } transform_2;

   mat4 modelview; // illegal as modelview already defined at this scope
   mat4 projection; // legal as projection and transform_2.projection are
                    // distinct.

Outside the shading language (i.e., in the API), members are similarly identified except the block name is
always used in place of the instance name (API accesses are to interfaces, not to shaders). If there is no
instance name, then the API does not use the block name to access a member, just the member name. For
example:




                                              39
                                                                                         4 Variables and Types



           uniform Transform_1
           {
               mat4 modelview; // API will use âmodelviewâ
           }

           uniform Transform_2
           {
               mat4 projection; // API will use âTransform_2.projectionâ
           } transform_2;

        For blocks declared as arrays, the array index must also be included when accessing members, as in this
        example
           uniform Transform { // API uses âTransform[2]â to refer to instance 2
               mat4           ModelViewMatrix;
               mat4           ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
               float          Deformation;
           } transforms[4];
           ...
           ... = transforms[2].ModelViewMatrix; // shader access of instance 2
           // API uses âTransform.ModelViewMatrixâ to query an offset or other query

        For uniform blocks declared as an array, each individual array element corresponds to a separate buffer
        object backing one instance of the block. As the array size indicates the number of buffer objects needed,
        uniform block array declarations must specify an array size. All indexes used to index a uniform block
        array must be constant integral expressions.
        When using OpenGL ES API entry points to identify the name of an individual block in an array of
        blocks, the name string must include an array index (e.g., Transform[2]). When using OpenGL ES API
        entry points to refer to offsets or other characteristics of a block member, an array index must not be
        specified (e.g., Transform.ModelViewMatrix).
        There is an implementation dependent limit on the number of uniform blocks that can be used per stage.
        If this limit is exceeded, it will cause a link error.

4.3.8   Layout Qualifiers
        Layout qualifiers can appear in several forms of declaration. They can appear as part of an interface
        block definition or block member, as shown in the grammar in the previous section. They can also appear
        with just a uniform to establish layouts of other uniform declarations:
             layout-qualifier uniform ;
        Or, they can appear with an individual variable declared with an interface qualifier:
             layout-qualifier interface-qualifier declaration ;
        Declarations of layouts can only be made at global scope, and only where indicated in the following
        subsections; their details are specific to what the interface qualifier is, and are discussed individually.

       Interface qualifiers are a subset of storage qualifiers:
            interface-qualifier:
                  in
                  out
                  uniform
       As shown in the previous section, layout-qualifier expands to:
            layout-qualifier :
                 layout ( layout-qualifier-id-list )
       The tokens in any layout-qualifier-id-list are identifiers, not keywords. Generally, they can be listed in
       any order. Order-dependent meanings exist only if explicitly called out below. As for other identifiers,
       they are case sensitive.

4.3.8.1 Input Layout Qualifiers
       Vertex shaders allow input layout qualifiers on input variable declarations. The layout qualifier identifier
       for vertex shader inputs is:
            layout-qualifier-id
                 location = integer-constant
       Only one argument is accepted. For example,
          layout(location = 3) in vec4 normal;

       will establish that the vertex shader input normal is copied in from vector location number 3.


       If an input variable with no location assigned in the shader text has a location specified through the
       OpenGL ES API, the API-assigned location will be used. Otherwise, such variables will be assigned a
       location by the linker. See section 2.11.5 âVertex Attributesâ of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Graphics System
       Specification for more details.
       Fragment shaders cannot have input layout qualifiers.

4.3.8.2 Output Layout Qualifiers
       Vertex shaders cannot have output layout qualifiers.
       In the fragment shader, a binding between an output variable and a numbered draw buffer is established
       by the location layout qualifier in the output declaration. The location of each output corresponds to the
       draw buffer the data is written to. Locations are integral values in the range
       [0, MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS â 1].
       Fragment shaders allow output layout qualifiers only on the interface qualifier out. The layout qualifier
       identifier for fragment shader outputs is:
            layout-qualifier-id
                 location = integer-constant




                                                        41
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



       The qualifier may appear at most once within a declaration. For example,
          layout(location = 3) out vec4 color;

       will establish that the fragment shader output color is copied out to draw buffer 3.
       If the named fragment shader output is an array, it will be assigned consecutive locations starting with the
       location specified. For example,
          layout(location = 2) out vec4 colors[3];

       will establish that colors is copied out to draw buffers 2, 3, and 4.
       If there is only a single output, the location does not need to be specified, in which case it defaults to zero.
       This applies for all output types, including arrays. For example,
          out vec4 my_FragColor; // must be the only output declaration

       will establish that the fragment shader output my_FragColor is copied out to draw buffer 0. Likewise,
          out vec4 my_FragData[4]; // must be the only output declaration

       will establish that the fragment shader outputs my_FragData[0] to my_FragData[3] is copied out to
       draw buffers 0 through 3 respectively.
       If there is more than one output, the location must be specified for all outputs. It is an error if any of the
       following occur:
           â¢      The location of any output or element of an array output, is greater or equal to the value of
                  MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.
           â¢      More than one output or element of an array output is bound to the same location.
        See section 3.9.2 âShader Executionâ of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Graphics System Specification for more
       details.

4.3.8.3 Uniform Block Layout Qualifiers
       Layout qualifiers can be used for uniform blocks, but not for non-block uniform declarations. The layout
       qualifier identifiers for uniform blocks are:
               layout-qualifier-id
                    shared
                    packed
                    std140
                    row_major
                    column_major


       None of these have any semantic affect at all on the usage of the variables being declared; they only
       describe how data is laid out in memory. For example, matrix semantics are always column-based, as
       described in the rest of this specification, no matter what layout qualifiers are being used.




                                                        42
                                                                                  4 Variables and Types



Uniform block layout qualifiers can be declared for global scope, on a single uniform block, or on a single
block member declaration.
Default layouts are established at global scope for uniform blocks as
   layout(layout-qualifier-id-list) uniform;

When this is done, the previous default qualification is first inherited and then overridden as per the
override rules listed below for each qualifier listed in the declaration. The result becomes the new default
qualification scoped to subsequent uniform block definitions.
The initial state of compilation is as if the following were declared:
   layout(shared, column_major) uniform;

Explicitly declaring this in a shader will return defaults back to their initial state.
Uniform blocks can be declared with optional layout qualifiers, and so can their individual member
declarations. Such block layout qualification is scoped only to the content of the block. As with global
layout declarations, block layout qualification first inherits from the current default qualification and then
overrides it. Similarly, individual member layout qualification is scoped just to the member declaration,
and inherits from and overrides the block's qualification.
The shared qualifier overrides only the std140 and packed qualifiers; other qualifiers are inherited. The
compiler/linker will ensure that multiple programs and programmable stages containing this definition will
share the same memory layout for this block, as long as they also matched in their row_major and/or
column_major qualifications. This allows use of the same buffer to back the same block definition across
different programs.
The packed qualifier overrides only std140 and shared; other qualifiers are inherited. When packed is
used, no shareable layout is guaranteed. The compiler and linker can optimize memory use based on what
variables actively get used and on other criteria. Offsets must be queried, as there is no other way of
guaranteeing where (and which) variables reside within the block. Attempts to share a packed uniform
block across programs or stages will generally fail. However, implementations may aid application
management of packed blocks by using canonical layouts for packed blocks.
The std140 qualifier overrides only the packed and shared qualifiers; other qualifiers are inherited. The
layout is explicitly determined by this, as described in section 2.11.5 âUniform Variablesâ under
âStandard Uniform Block Layoutâ of the OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification. Hence, as in
shared above, the resulting layout is shareable across programs.
Layout qualifiers on member declarations cannot use the shared, packed, or std140 qualifiers. These can
only be used at global scope or on a block declaration.
The row_major qualifier overrides only the column_major qualifier; other qualifiers are inherited. It only
affects the layout of matrices. Elements within a matrix row will be contiguous in memory.
The column_major qualifier overrides only the row_major qualifier; other qualifiers are inherited. It only
affects the layout of matrices. Elements within a matrix column will be contiguous in memory.
When multiple arguments are listed in a layout declaration, the effect will be the same as if they were
declared one at a time, in order from left to right, each in turn inheriting from and overriding the result
from the previous qualification.




                                                  43
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Layout qualifiers are identifiers, not keywords and they have their own name space.
        For example
           layout(row_major, column_major)

        results in the qualification being column_major. Other examples:
           layout(shared, row_major) uniform; // default is now shared and row_major

           layout(std140) uniform Transform {                //   layout of this block is std140
               mat4 M1;                                      //   row_major
               layout(column_major) mat4 M2;                 //   column major
               mat3 N1;                                      //   row_major
           };

           uniform T2 {        // layout of this block is shared
               ...
           };

           layout(column_major) uniform T3 {                 //   shared and column_major
               mat4 M3;                                      //   column_major
               layout(row_major) mat4 m4;                    //   row major
               mat3 N2;                                      //   column_major
           };

4.3.9   Interpolation
        The presence of and type of interpolation is controlled by the storage qualifiers centroid in and centroid
        out, and by the optional interpolation qualifiers smooth and flat. When no interpolation qualifier is
        present, smooth interpolation is used. It is a compile-time error to use more than one interpolation
        qualifier.
        A variable qualified as flat will not be interpolated. Instead, it will have the same value for every
        fragment within a triangle. This value will come from a single provoking vertex, as described by the
        OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification. A variable may be qualified as flat centroid, which will
        mean the same thing as qualifying it only as flat.
        A variable qualified as smooth will be interpolated in a perspective-correct manner over the primitive
        being rendered. Interpolation in a perspective correct manner is specified in equations 3.4 in the OpenGL
        ES 3.0 Graphics System Specification, section 3.5 âLine Segmentsâ.
        This paragraph only applies if interpolation is being done: If single-sampling, the value is interpolated to
        the pixel's center, and the centroid qualifier, if present, is ignored. If multi-sampling and the variable is
        not qualified with centroid, then the value must be interpolated to the pixel's center, or anywhere within
        the pixel, or to one of the pixel's samples. If multi-sampling and the variable is qualified with centroid,
        then the value must be interpolated to a point that lies in both the pixel and in the primitive being
        rendered, or to one of the pixel's samples that falls within the primitive. Due to the less regular location of
        centroids, their derivatives may be less accurate than non-centroid interpolated variables.




                                                        44
                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



       The type and presence of the interpolation qualifiers and storage qualifiers and invariant qualifiers of
       variables with the same name declared in all linked shaders must match, otherwise the link command will
       fail.

4.3.10 Linking of Vertex Outputs and Fragment Inputs
       The type of vertex outputs and fragment input with the same name must match, otherwise the link
       command will fail. The precision does not need to match. Only those fragment inputs statically used (i.e.
       read) in the fragment shader must be declared as outputs in the vertex shader; declaring superfluous vertex
       shader outputs is permissible.
       The following table summarizes the rules for matching vertex outputs with fragment inputs:

                                                                     Fragment Shader Inputs
                                                      No reference           Declares;             Declares
                                                                            no static use        and static use

             Vertex
                                 no static use                                                    (values are
             Shader
                                                                                                  undefined)

                                and static use                                                    (values are
                                                                                                  potentially
                                                                                                  undefined)
       The term static use means that after preprocessing the shader includes at least one statement that accesses
       the input or output, even if that statement is never actually executed.
       The precision of a vertex output does not need to match the precision of the corresponding fragment input.
       The minimum precision at which vertex outputs are interpolated is the minimum of the vertex output
       precision and the fragment input precision, with the exception that for highp, implementations do not have
       to support full IEEE 754 precision. In this case, the precision of the interpolated value is defined by a
       range and resolution as below:
       The precision of values exported to a transform feedback buffer is the precision of the outputs of the
       vertex shader.

4.4     Parameter Qualifiers
        Parameters can have these qualifiers.

        Parameter qualifiers are discussed in more detail in section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.

4.5     Precision and Precision Qualifiers
4.5.1   Range and Precision
        The precision of highp floating-point variables is defined by the IEEE 754 standard for 32-bit floating-
        point numbers. This includes support for NaNs (Not a Number) and Infs (positive or negative infinities).
        The following rules apply to highp operations: Infinities and zeros are generated as dictated by IEEE,
        but subject to the precisions allowed in the following table and subject to allowing positive and negative
        zeros to be interchanged. However, dividing a non-zero by 0 results in the appropriately signed IEEE Inf:
        If both positive and negative zeros are implemented, the correctly signed Inf will be generated, otherwise
        positive Inf is generated. Any subnormal (denormalized) value input into a shader or potentially
        generated by any operation in a shader can be flushed to 0. The rounding mode cannot be set and is
        undefined. NaNs are not required to be generated. Support for signaling NaNs is not required and
        exceptions are never raised. Operations and built-in functions that operate on a NaN are not required to
        return a NaN as the result. However if NaNs are generated, isnan() should return the correct value.
        Precisions are expressed in terms of maximum relative error in units of ULP (units in the last place),
        unless otherwise noted.




                                                       46
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



For single precision operations, precisions are required as follows:

      Operation                         Precision
      a + b, a â b, a * b               Correctly rounded.
      <, <=, ==, >, >=                  Correct result.
      a / b,    1.0 / b                 2.5 ULP for b in the range [2-126, 2126].
      a*b+c                             Correctly rounded single operation or sequence of
                                        two correctly rounded operations.
      pow(x, y)                         Inherited from exp2 (x * log2 (y)).
      exp (x), exp2 (x)                 (3 + 2 * |x|) ULP.
      log (), log2 ()                   3 ULP outside the range [0.5, 2.0].
                                        Absolute error < 2-21 inside the range [0.5, 2.0].
      sqrt ()                           Inherited from 1.0 / inversesqrt().
      inversesqrt ()                    2 ULP.
      explicit                          Correctly rounded.
      conversions between types


The rounding mode is not defined but must not affect the result by more than 1 ULP.
Built-in functions defined in the specification with an equation built from the above operations inherit the
above errors. These include, for example, the geometric functions, the common functions, and many of
the matrix functions. Built-in functions not listed above and not defined as equations of the above have
undefined precision. These include, for example, the trigonometric functions and determinant.
Storage requirements are declared through use of precision qualifiers. The precision of operations must
preserve the storage precisions of the variables involved.
highp floating point values are stored in IEEE 754 single precision floating point format. Mediump and
lowp floating point values have minimum range and precision requirements as detailed below and have
maximum range and precision as defined by IEEE 754.
All integer types are assumed to be implemented as integers and so may not be emulated by floating point
values. Highp signed integers are represented as twos-complement 32-bit signed integers. Highp
unsigned integers are represented as unsigned 32-bit integers. Mediump integers (signed and unsigned)
must be represented as an integer with between 16 and 32 bits inclusive. Lowp integers (signed and
unsigned) must be represented as an integer with between 9 and 32 bits inclusive.

        In addition, the range and precision of a mediump floating point value must be the same as or greater than
        the range and precision of a lowp floating point value. The range and precision of a highp floating point
        value must be the same as or greater than the range and precision of a mediump floating point value.
        The range of a mediump integer value must be the same as or greater than the range of a lowp integer
        value. The range of a highp integer value must be the same as or greater than the range of a mediump
        integer value.
        Within the above specification, an implementation is allowed to vary the representation of numeric values,
        both within a shader and between different shaders. If necessary, this variance can be controlled using the
        invariance qualifier.
        The actual ranges and precisions provided by an implementation can be queried through the API. See the
        OpenGL ES 3.0 specification for details on how to do this.

4.5.2   Conversion between precisions
        Within the same type, conversion from a lower to a higher precision must be exact. When converting
        from a higher precision to a lower precision, if the value is representable by the implementation of the
        target precision, the conversion must also be exact. If the value is not representable, the behavior is
        dependent on the type:
            â¢     For signed and unsigned integers, the value is truncated; bits in positions not present in the target
                  precision are set to zero. (Positions start at zero and the least significant bit is considered to be
                  position zero for this purpose.)
            â¢     For floating point values, the value should either clamp to +INF or -INF, or to the maximum or
                  minimum value that the implementation supports. While this behavior is implementation
                  dependent, it should be consistent for a given implementation.

                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



4.5.3   Precision Qualifiers
        Any floating point or any integer declaration can have the type preceded by one of these precision
        qualifiers:

               Qualifier      Meaning
               highp          The variable satisfies the minimum requirements for highp described above.
                              Highp variables have the maximum range and precision available but may
                              cause operations to run more slowly on some implementations.
               mediump        The variable satisfies the minimum requirements for mediump described
                              above. Mediump variables may typically be used to store high dynamic
                              range colors and low precision geometry.
               lowp           The variable satisfies the minimum requirements for lowp described above.
                              Lowp variables may typically be used to store 8-bit color values.


        For example:
           lowp float color;
           out mediump vec2 P;
           lowp ivec2 foo(lowp mat3);
           highp mat4 m;

        Literal constants do not have precision qualifiers. Neither do Boolean variables. Neither do floating
        point constructors nor integer constructors when none of the constructor arguments have precision
        qualifiers.
        For this paragraph, âoperationâ includes operators, built-in functions, and constructors, and âoperandâ
        includes function arguments and constructor arguments. The precision used to internally evaluate an
        operation, and the precision qualification subsequently associated with any resulting intermediate values,
        must be at least as high as the highest precision qualification of the operands consumed by the operation.
        For constant expressions and sub-expressions, where the precision is not defined, the evaluation is
        performed at or above the highest supported precision of the target (either mediump or highp). The
        evaluation of constant expressions must be invariant and will usually be performed at compile time.
        In other cases where operands do not have a precision qualifier, the precision qualification will come from
        the other operands. If no operands have a precision qualifier, then the precision qualifications of the
        operands of the next consuming operation in the expression will be used. This rule can be applied
        recursively until a precision qualified operand is found. If necessary, it will also include the precision
        qualification of l-values for assignments, of the declared variable for initializers, of formal parameters for
        function call arguments, or of function return types for function return values. If the precision cannot be
        determined by this method e.g. if an entire expression is composed only of operands with no precision
        qualifier, and the result is not assigned or passed as an argument, then it is evaluated at the default
        precision of the type or greater. When this occurs in the fragment shader, the default precision must be
        defined.




                                                        49
                                                                                         4 Variables and Types



        For example, consider the statements.
           uniform highp float h1;
           highp float h2 = 2.3 * 4.7;              // operation and result are highp precision
           mediump float m;
           m = 3.7 * h1 * h2;                       //   all operations are highp precision
           h2 = m * h1;                             //   operation is highp precision
           m = h2 â h1;                             //   operation is highp precision
           h2 = m + m;                              //   addition and result at mediump precision
           void f(highp float p);
           f(3.3);                                  // 3.3 will be passed in at highp precision

        Precision qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not affect the basic type of the variable. In particular,
        there are no constructors for precision conversions; constructors only convert types. Similarly, precision
        qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not contribute to function overloading based on parameter types.
        As discussed in the next chapter, function input and output is done through copies, and therefore qualifiers
        do not have to match.
        The same uniform declared in different shaders that are linked together must have the same precision
        qualification.
        The precision of a variable is determined when the variable is declared and cannot be subsequently
        changed.

4.5.4   Default Precision Qualifiers
        The precision statement
           precision precision-qualifier type;

        can be used to establish a default precision qualifier. The type field can be either int or float or any of
        the sampler types, and the precision-qualifier can be lowp, mediump, or highp. Any other types or
        qualifiers will result in an error. If type is float, the directive applies to non-precision-qualified floating
        point type (scalar, vector, and matrix) declarations. If type is int, the directive applies to all non-
        precision-qualified integer type (scalar, vector, signed, and unsigned) declarations. This includes global
        variable declarations, function return declarations, function parameter declarations, and local variable
        declarations.
        Non-precision qualified declarations will use the precision qualifier specified in the most recent precision
        statement that is still in scope. The precision statement has the same scoping rules as variable
        declarations. If it is declared inside a compound statement, its effect stops at the end of the innermost
        statement it was declared in. Precision statements in nested scopes override precision statements in outer
        scopes. Multiple precision statements for the same basic type can appear inside the same scope, with later
        statements overriding earlier statements within that scope.

                                                                                   4 Variables and Types



      The vertex language has the following predeclared globally scoped default precision statements:
         precision highp float;
         precision highp int;

         precision lowp sampler2D;
         precision lowp samplerCube;

      The fragment language has the following predeclared globally scoped default precision statements:
         precision mediump int;

         precision lowp sampler2D;
         precision lowp samplerCube;

      The fragment language has no default precision qualifier for floating point types. Hence for float, floating
      point vector and matrix variable declarations, either the declaration must include a precision qualifier or
      the default float precision must have been previously declared. Similarly, there is no default precision
      qualifier for the following sampler types in either the vertex or fragment language:
         sampler3D;

         samplerCubeShadow;
         sampler2DShadow;
         sampler2DArray;
         sampler2DArrayShadow;
         isampler2D;
         isampler3D;
         isamplerCube;
         isampler2DArray;
         usampler2D;
         usampler3D;
         usamplerCube;
         usampler2DArray;


4.6   Variance and the Invariant Qualifier
      In this section, variance refers to the possibility of getting different values from the same expression in
      different programs. For example, say two vertex shaders, in different programs, each set gl_Position with
      the same expression in both shaders, and the input values into that expression are the same when both
      shaders run. It is possible, due to independent compilation of the two shaders, that the values assigned to
      gl_Position are not exactly the same when the two shaders run. In this example, this can cause problems
      with alignment of geometry in a multi-pass algorithm.
      In general, such variance between shaders is allowed. When such variance does not exist for a particular
      output variable, that variable is said to be invariant.




                                                     51
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



4.6.1   The Invariant Qualifier
        To ensure that a particular output variable is invariant, it is necessary to use the invariant qualifier. It can
        either be used to qualify a previously declared variable as being invariant
            invariant gl_Position;             // make built-in gl_Position be invariant

            out vec3 Color;
            invariant Color;                   // make existing Color be invariant

            invariant Color_2;                // error: Color_2 has not been declared

        or as part of a declaration when a variable is declared
            invariant centroid out vec3 Color;

        The invariant qualifier must appear before any interpolation qualifiers or storage qualifiers when
        combined with a declaration. Only variables output from a shader can be candidates for invariance. This
        includes user-defined output variables and the built-in output variables. As only outputs can be declared
        as invariant, an invariant output from one shader stage will still match an input of a subsequent stage
        without the input being declared as invariant.
        The invariant keyword can be followed by a comma separated list of previously declared identifiers. All
        uses of invariant must be at the global scope, and before any use of the variables being declared as
        invariant.
        To guarantee invariance of a particular output variable across two programs, the following must also be
        true:
        â¢   The output variable is declared as invariant in both programs.
        â¢   The same values must be input to all shader input variables consumed by expressions and control flow
            contributing to the value assigned to the output variable.
        â¢   The texture formats, texel values, and texture filtering are set the same way for any texture function
            calls contributing to the value of the output variable.
        â¢   All input values are all operated on in the same way. All operations in the consuming expressions and
            any intermediate expressions must be the same, with the same order of operands and same
            associativity, to give the same order of evaluation. Intermediate variables and functions must be
            declared as the same type with the same explicit or implicit precision qualifiers and the same constant
            qualifiers. Any control flow affecting the output value must be the same, and any expressions
            consumed to determine this control flow must also follow these invariance rules.
        â¢   All the data flow and control flow leading to setting the invariant output variable reside in a single
            compilation unit.
        Essentially, all the data flow and control flow leading to an invariant output must match.




                                                        52
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        Initially, by default, all output variables are allowed to be variant. To force all output variables to be
        invariant, use the pragma
           #pragma STDGL invariant(all)

        before all declarations in a shader. If this pragma is used after the declaration of any variables or
        functions, then the set of outputs that behave as invariant is undefined. It is an error to use this pragma in
        a fragment shader.
        Generally, invariance is ensured at the cost of flexibility in optimization, so performance can be degraded
        by use of invariance. Hence, use of this pragma is intended as a debug aid, to avoid individually declaring
        all output variables as invariant.

4.6.2   Invariance Within a Shader
        When a value is stored in a variable, it is usually assumed it will remain constant unless explicitly
        changed. However, during the process of optimization, it is possible that the compiler may choose to
        recompute a value rather than store it in a register. Since the precision of operations is not completely
        specified (e.g. a low precision operation may be done at medium or high precision), it would be possible
        for the recomputed value to be different from the original value.
        Values are allowed to be variant within a shader. To prevent this, the invariant qualifier or invariant
        pragma must be used.
        Within a shader, there is no invariance for values generated by different non-constant expressions, even if
        those expressions are identical.
        Example 1:
           precision mediump;
           vec4 col;
           vec2 a = ...
           ...
           col = texture(tex, a);                // a has a value a1
           ...
           col = texture(tex, a);                // a has a value a2 where possibly a1 â  a2

        To enforce invariance in this example use:
           #pragma STDGL invariant(all)

        Example 2:
           vec2   m   =   ...;
           vec2   n   =   ...;
           vec2   a   =   m + n;
           vec2   b   =   m + n;       // a and b are not guaranteed to be exactly equal

        There is no mechanism to enforce invariance between a and b.

                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.6.3   Invariance of Constant Expressions
        Invariance must be guaranteed for constant expressions. A particular constant expression must evaluate to
        the same result if it appears again in the same shader or a different shader. This includes the same
        expression appearing two shaders of the same language or shaders of two different languages.
        Constant expressions must evaluate to the same result when operated on as already described above for
        invariant variables. Constant expressions are not invariant with respect to equivalent non-constant
        expressions, even when the invariant qualifier or pragma is used.

4.6.4   Invariance of Undefined Values
        Undefined values are not invariant nor can they be made invariant by use of the invariant qualifier or
        pragma. In some implementations, undefined values may cause unexpected behavior if they are used in
        control-flow expressions e.g. in the following case, one, both or neither functions may be executed and
        this may not be consistent over multiple invocations of the shader:
           int x; // undefined value
           if (x == 1)
           {
             f(); // Undefined whether f() is executed
           }
           if (x == 2)
           {
             g(); // Undefined whether g() is executed.
           }

        Note that an undefined value is a value that has not been specified. A value that has been specified but
        has a potentially large error due to, for example, lack of precision in an expression, is not undefined and
        so can be made invariant.

4.7     Order of Qualification
        When multiple qualifications are present, they must follow a strict order. This order is as follows.
                 invariant-qualifier interpolation-qualifier storage-qualifier precision-qualifier
                 storage-qualifier parameter-qualifier precision-qualifier

5 Operators and Expressions

5.1   Operators
      The OpenGL ES Shading Language has the following operators.

      There is no address-of operator nor a dereference operator. There is no typecast operator; constructors
      are used instead.




                                                      55
                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



5.2     Array Operations
        These are now described in section 5.7 âStructure and Array Operationsâ.

5.3     Function Calls
        If a function returns a value, then a call to that function may be used as an expression, whose type will be
        the type that was used to declare or define the function.
        Function definitions and calling conventions are discussed in section 6.1 âFunction Definitionsâ .

5.4     Constructors
        Constructors use the function call syntax, where the function name is a type, and the call makes an object
        of that type. Constructors are used the same way in both initializers and expressions. (See section 9
        âShading Language Grammarâ for details.) The parameters are used to initialize the constructed value.
        Constructors can be used to request a data type conversion to change from one scalar type to another
        scalar type, or to build larger types out of smaller types, or to reduce a larger type to a smaller type.
        In general, constructors are not built-in functions with predetermined prototypes. For arrays and
        structures, there must be exactly one argument in the constructor for each element or field. For the other
        types, the arguments must provide a sufficient number of components to perform the initialization, and it
        is an error to include so many arguments that they cannot all be used. Detailed rules follow. The
        prototypes actually listed below are merely a subset of examples.

5.4.1   Conversion and Scalar Constructors
        Converting between scalar types is done as the following prototypes indicate:
           int(bool)          //   converts   a Boolean value to an int
           int(float)         //   converts   a float value to an int
           float(bool)        //   converts   a Boolean value to a float
           float(int)         //   converts   a signed integer value to a float
           bool(float)        //   converts   a float value to a Boolean
           bool(int)          //   converts   a signed integer value to a Boolean
           uint(bool)         //   converts   a Boolean value to an unsigned integer
           uint(float)        //   converts   a float value to an unsigned integer
           uint(int)          //   converts   a signed integer value to an unsigned integer
           int(uint)          //   converts   an unsigned integer to a signed integer
           bool(uint)         //   converts   an unsigned integer value to a Boolean value
           float(uint)        //   converts   an unsigned integer value to a float value

        When constructors are used to convert a float to an int or uint, the fractional part of the floating-point
        value is dropped. It is undefined to convert a negative floating point value to an uint.
        When a constructor is used to convert an int, uint, or a float to a bool, 0 and 0.0 are converted to false,
        and non-zero values are converted to true. When a constructor is used to convert a bool to an int, uint,
        or float, false is converted to 0 or 0.0, and true is converted to 1 or 1.0.




                                                        56
                                                                                 5 Operators and Expressions



        The constructor int(uint) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will change the argument's
        value if its sign bit is set. The constructor uint(int) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will
        change its value if it is negative.
        Identity constructors, like float(float) are also legal, but of little use.
        Scalar constructors with non-scalar parameters can be used to take the first element from a non-scalar.
        For example, the constructor float(vec3) will select the first component of the vec3 parameter.

5.4.2   Vector and Matrix Constructors
        Constructors can be used to create vectors or matrices from a set of scalars, vectors, or matrices. This
        includes the ability to shorten vectors.
        If there is a single scalar parameter to a vector constructor, it is used to initialize all components of the
        constructed vector to that scalarâs value. If there is a single scalar parameter to a matrix constructor, it is
        used to initialize all the components on the matrixâs diagonal, with the remaining components initialized
        to 0.0.
        If a vector is constructed from multiple scalars, one or more vectors, or one or more matrices, or a mixture
        of these, the vector's components will be constructed in order from the components of the arguments. The
        arguments will be consumed left to right, and each argument will have all its components consumed, in
        order, before any components from the next argument are consumed. Similarly for constructing a matrix
        from multiple scalars or vectors, or a mixture of these. Matrix components will be constructed and
        consumed in column major order. In these cases, there must be enough components provided in the
        arguments to provide an initializer for every component in the constructed value. It is an error to provide
        extra arguments beyond this last used argument.
        If a matrix is constructed from a matrix, then each component (column i, row j) in the result that has a
        corresponding component (column i, row j) in the argument will be initialized from there. All other
        components will be initialized to the identity matrix. If a matrix argument is given to a matrix constructor,
        it is an error to have any other arguments.
        If the basic type (bool, int, or float) of a parameter to a constructor does not match the basic type of the
        object being constructed, the scalar construction rules (above) are used to convert the parameters.

                                                                        5 Operators and Expressions



Some useful vector constructors are as follows:
   vec3(float)        // initializes each component of the vec3 with the float
   vec4(ivec4)        // makes a vec4 with component-wise conversion
   vec4(mat2)         // the vec4 is column 0 followed by column 1

   vec2(float, float)                              // initializes a vec2 with 2 floats
   ivec3(int, int, int)                            // initializes an ivec3 with 3 ints
   bvec4(int, int, float, float)                   // uses 4 Boolean conversions

   vec2(vec3)                   // drops the third component of a vec3
   vec3(vec4)                   // drops the fourth component of a vec4

   vec3(vec2, float)            // vec3.x = vec2.x, vec3.y = vec2.y, vec3.z = float
   vec3(float, vec2)            // vec3.x = float, vec3.y = vec2.x, vec3.z = vec2.y
   vec4(vec3, float)
   vec4(float, vec3)
   vec4(vec2, vec2)

Some examples of these are:
   vec4 color = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
   vec4 rgba = vec4(1.0);    // sets each component to 1.0
   vec3 rgb   = vec3(color); // drop the 4th component

To initialize the diagonal of a matrix with all other elements set to zero:
   mat2(float)
   mat3(float)
   mat4(float)

That is, result[i][j] is set to the float argument for all i = j and set to 0 for all iâ  j.

        To initialize a matrix by specifying vectors or scalars, the components are assigned to the matrix elements
        in column-major order.
           mat2(vec2, vec2);                          //   one    column   per   argument
           mat3(vec3, vec3, vec3);                    //   one    column   per   argument
           mat4(vec4, vec4, vec4, vec4);              //   one    column   per   argument
           mat3x2(vec2, vec2, vec2);                  //   one    column   per   argument

           mat2(float, float,                // first column
                float, float);               // second column

           mat3(float, float, float,                  // first column
                float, float, float,                  // second column
                float, float, float);                 // third column

           mat4(float,      float,    float,    float,       //   first column
                float,      float,    float,    float,       //   second column
                float,      float,    float,    float,       //   third column
                float,      float,    float,    float);      //   fourth column

           mat2x3(vec2, float,                // first column
                  vec2, float);               // second column

        A wide range of other possibilities exist, to construct a matrix from vectors and scalars, as long as enough
        components are present to initialize the matrix. To construct a matrix from a matrix:
           mat3x3(mat4x4);         // takes the upper-left 3x3 of the mat4x4
           mat2x3(mat4x2);         // takes the upper-left 2x2 of the mat4x4, last row is 0,0
           mat4x4(mat3x3);         // puts the mat3x3 in the upper-left, sets the lower right
                                   //    component to 1, and the rest to 0

5.4.3   Structure Constructors
        Once a structure is defined, and its type is given a name, a constructor is available with the same name to
        construct instances of that structure. For example:
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           };

           light lightVar = light(3.0, vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0));

        The arguments to the constructor will be used to set the structure's fields, in order, using one argument per
        field. Each argument must be the same type as the field it sets.
        Structure constructors can be used as initializers or in expressions.




                                                        59
                                                                            5 Operators and Expressions



5.4.4   Array Constructors
        Array types can also be used as constructor names, which can then be used in expressions or initializers.
        For example,
           const float c[3] = float[3](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);
           const float d[3] = float[](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);

           float g;
           ...
           float a[5] = float[5](g, 1, g, 2.3, g);
           float b[3];

           b = float[3](g, g + 1.0, g + 2.0);

        There must be exactly the same number of arguments as the size of the array being constructed. The
        arguments are assigned in order, starting at element 0, to the elements of the constructed array. Each
        argument must be the same type as the element type of the array.

5.5     Vector Components
        The names of the components of a vector are denoted by a single letter. As a notational convenience,
        several letters are associated with each component based on common usage of position, color or texture
        coordinate vectors. The individual components of a vector can be selected by following the variable name
        with period ( . ) and then the component name.
        The component names supported are:

              {x, y, z, w}       Useful when accessing vectors that represent points or normals
              {r, g, b, a}             Useful when accessing vectors that represent colors
              {s, t, p, q}       Useful when accessing vectors that represent texture coordinates


        The component names x, r, and s are, for example, synonyms for the same (first) component in a vector.
        Note that the third component of the texture coordinate set, r in OpenGL ES, has been renamed p so as to
        avoid the confusion with r (for red) in a color.
        Accessing components beyond those declared for the vector type is an error so, for example:
           vec2 pos;
           pos.x // is legal
           pos.z // is illegal




                                                       60
                                                                       5 Operators and Expressions



The component selection syntax allows multiple components to be selected by appending their names
(from the same name set) after the period ( . ).
   vec4 v4;
   v4.rgba;       //   is   a vec4 and the same as just using v4,
   v4.rgb;        //   is   a vec3,
   v4.b;          //   is   a float,
   v4.xy;         //   is   a vec2,
   v4.xgba;       //   is   illegal - the component names do not come from
                  //                  the same set.

No more than 4 components can be selected.
   vec4 v4;
   v4.xyzw;        // is a vec4
   v4.xyzwxy;      // is illegal since it has 6 components
   (v4.xyzwxy).xy; // is illegal since the intermediate value has 6 components

   vec2 v2;
   v2.xyxy;                 // is legal. It evaluates to a vec4.

The order of the components can be different to swizzle them, or replicated:
   vec4 pos = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
   vec4 swiz= pos.wzyx; // swiz = (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
   vec4 dup = pos.xxyy; // dup = (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)

This notation is more concise than the constructor syntax. To form an r-value, it can be applied to any
expression that results in a vector r-value.
The component group notation can occur on the left hand side of an expression.
   vec4 pos     = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
   pos.xw =     vec2(5.0, 6.0);         // pos = (5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0)
   pos.wx =     vec2(7.0, 8.0);         // pos = (8.0, 2.0, 3.0, 7.0)
   pos.xx =     vec2(3.0, 4.0);         // illegal - 'x' used twice
   pos.xy =     vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);    // illegal - mismatch between vec2 and vec3

To form an l-value, swizzling must be applied to an l-value of vector type, contain no duplicate
components, and it results in an l-value of scalar or vector type, depending on number of components
specified.
Array subscripting syntax can also be applied to vectors to provide numeric indexing. So in
   vec4       pos;

pos[2] refers to the third element of pos and is equivalent to pos.z. This allows variable indexing into a
vector, as well as a generic way of accessing components. Any integer expression can be used as the
subscript. The first component is at index zero. Reading from or writing to a vector using a constant
integral expression with a value that is negative or greater than or equal to the size of the vector is illegal.
When indexing with non-constant expressions, behavior is undefined if the index is negative, or greater
than or equal to the size of the vector.

                                                                           5 Operators and Expressions



      Note that scalars are not considered to be single-component vectors and therefore the use of component
      selection operators on scalars is illegal.

5.6   Matrix Components
      The components of a matrix can be accessed using array subscripting syntax. Applying a single subscript
      to a matrix treats the matrix as an array of column vectors, and selects a single column, whose type is a
      vector of the same size as the (column size of the) matrix. The leftmost column is column 0. A second
      subscript would then operate on the resulting vector, as defined earlier for vectors. Hence, two subscripts
      select a column and then a row.
         mat4 m;
         m[1] = vec4(2.0);                    // sets the second column to all 2.0
         m[0][0] = 1.0;                       // sets the upper left element to 1.0
         m[2][3] = 2.0;                       // sets the 4th element of the third column to 2.0

      Behavior is undefined when accessing a component outside the bounds of a matrix with a non-constant
      expression. It is an error to access a matrix with a constant expression that is outside the bounds of the
      matrix.

5.7   Structure and Array Operations
      The fields of a structure and the length method of an array are selected using the period ( . ).
      In total, only the following operators are allowed to operate on arrays and structures as whole entities:

           field or method selector       .
           equality                       == !=
           assignment                     =
           indexing (arrays only)         []


      The equality operators and assignment operator are only allowed if the two operands are same size and
      type. Structure types must be of the same declared structure. When using the equality operators, two
      structures are equal if and only if all the fields are component-wise equal, and two arrays are equal if and
      only if all the elements are element-wise equal.
      Array elements are accessed using the array subscript operator ( [ ] ). An example of accessing an array
      element is
         diffuseColor += lightIntensity[3] * NdotL;

      Array indices start at zero. Array elements are accessed using an expression whose type is int or uint.




                                                      62
                                                                           5 Operators and Expressions



      Arrays can also be accessed with the method operator ( . ) and the length method to query the size of the
      array:
          lightIntensity.length()              // return the size of the array


5.8   Assignments
      Assignments of values to variable names are done with the assignment operator ( = ):
          lvalue-expression = rvalue-expression

      The lvalue-expression evaluates to an l-value. The assignment operator stores the value of rvalue-
      expression into the l-value and returns an r-value with the type and precision of lvalue-expression. The
      lvalue-expression and rvalue-expression must have the same type. Any type-conversions must be
      specified explicitly via constructors. L-values must be writable. Variables that are built-in types, entire
      structures or arrays, structure fields, l-values with the field selector ( . ) applied to select components or
      swizzles without repeated fields, l-values within parentheses, and l-values dereferenced with the array
      subscript operator ( [ ] ) are all l-values. Other binary or unary expressions, function names, swizzles with
      repeated fields, and constants cannot be l-values. The ternary operator (?:) is also not allowed as an l-
      value.
      Expressions on the left of an assignment are evaluated before expressions on the right of the assignment.
      The other assignment operators are
      â¢   add into (+=)
      â¢   subtract from (-=)
      â¢   multiply into (*=)
      â¢   divide into (/=)
      â¢   modulus into (%=)
      â¢   left shift by (<<=)
      â¢   right shift by (>>=)
      â¢   and into (&=)
      â¢   inclusive-or into (|=)
      â¢   exclusive-or into (^=)
      where the general expression

           lvalue op= expression

      is equivalent to

           lvalue = lvalue op expression

      where op is as described below, and the l-value and expression must satisfy the semantic requirements of
      both op and equals (=).




                                                      63
                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



      Reading a variable before writing (or initializing) it is legal, however the value is undefined.

5.9   Expressions
      Expressions in the shading language are built from the following:
      â¢   Constants of type bool, int, uint, float, all vector types, and all matrix types.
      â¢   Constructors of all types.
      â¢   Variable names of all types.
      â¢   An array name with the length method applied.
      â¢   Subscripted array names.
      â¢   Function calls that return values.
      â¢   Component field selectors and array subscript results.
      â¢   Parenthesized expression. Any expression can be parenthesized. Parentheses can be used to group
          operations. Operations within parentheses are done before operations across parentheses.
      â¢   The arithmetic binary operators add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) operate on integer and
          floating-point scalars, vectors, and matrices. . If the operands are integer types, they must both be
          signed or both be unsigned. All arithmetic binary operators result in the same fundamental type
          (signed integer, unsigned integer, or floating-point) as the operands they operate on, after operand type
          conversion. After conversion, the following cases are valid
          â¢   The two operands are scalars. In this case the operation is applied, resulting in a scalar.
          â¢   One operand is a scalar, and the other is a vector or matrix. In this case, the scalar operation is
              applied independently to each component of the vector or matrix, resulting in the same size vector
              or matrix.
          â¢   The two operands are vectors of the same size. In this case, the operation is done component-wise
              resulting in the same size vector.
          â¢   The operator is add (+), subtract (-), or divide (/), and the operands are matrices with the same
              number of rows and the same number of columns. In this case, the operation is done component-
              wise resulting in the same size matrix.
          â¢   The operator is multiply (*), where both operands are matrices or one operand is a vector and the
              other a matrix. A right vector operand is treated as a column vector and a left vector operand as a
              row vector. In all these cases, it is required that the number of columns of the left operand is equal
              to the number of rows of the right operand. Then, the multiply (*) operation does a linear
              algebraic multiply, yielding an object that has the same number of rows as the left operand and the
              same number of columns as the right operand. Section 5.10 âVector and Matrix Operationsâ
              explains in more detail how vectors and matrices are operated on.
          All other cases are illegal.




                                                       64
                                                                       5 Operators and Expressions



    Dividing by zero does not cause an exception but does result in an unspecified value. Use the built-in
    functions dot, cross, matrixCompMult, and outerProduct, to get, respectively, vector dot product,
    vector cross product, matrix component-wise multiplication, and the matrix product of a column
    vector times a row vector.
â¢   The operator modulus (%) operates on signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors. The operand
    types must both be signed or both be unsigned. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size. If
    one operand is a scalar and the other vector, then the scalar is applied component-wise to the vector,
    resulting in the same type as the vector. If both are vectors of the same size, the result is computed
    component-wise. The resulting value is undefined for any component computed with a second
    operand that is zero, while results for other components with non-zero second operands remain
    defined. If both operands are non-negative, then the remainder is non-negative. Results are undefined
    if one or both operands are negative. The operator modulus (%) is not defined for any other data
    types (non-integer types).
â¢   The arithmetic unary operators negate (-), post- and pre-increment and decrement (-- and ++) operate
    on integer or floating-point values (including vectors and matrices). All unary operators work
    component-wise on their operands. These result with the same type they operated on. For post- and
    pre-increment and decrement, the expression must be one that could be assigned to (an l-value). Pre-
    increment and pre-decrement add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents of the expression they operate on,
    and the value of the pre-increment or pre-decrement expression is the resulting value of that
    modification. Post-increment and post-decrement expressions add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents
    of the expression they operate on, but the resulting expression has the expressionâs value before the
    post-increment or post-decrement was executed.
â¢   The relational operators greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal (>=), and less than or
    equal (<=) operate only on scalar integer and scalar floating-point expressions. The result is scalar
    Boolean. The types of the operands must match. To do component-wise relational comparisons on
    vectors, use the built-in functions lessThan, lessThanEqual, greaterThan, and greaterThanEqual.
â¢   The equality operators equal (==), and not equal (!=) operate on all types. They result in a scalar
    Boolean. The types of the operands must match. For vectors, matrices, structures, and arrays, all
    components, fields, or elements of one operand must equal the corresponding components, fields, or
    elements in the other operand for the operands to be considered equal. To get a vector of component-
    wise equality results for vectors, use the built-in functions equal and notEqual.
â¢   The logical binary operators and (&&), or ( | | ), and exclusive or (^^) operate only on two Boolean
    expressions and result in a Boolean expression. And (&&) will only evaluate the right hand operand
    if the left hand operand evaluated to true. Or ( | | ) will only evaluate the right hand operand if the left
    hand operand evaluated to false. Exclusive or (^^) will always evaluate both operands.
â¢   The logical unary operator not (!). It operates only on a Boolean expression and results in a Boolean
    expression. To operate on a vector, use the built-in function not.
â¢   The sequence ( , ) operator that operates on expressions by returning the type and value of the right-
    most expression in a comma separated list of expressions. All expressions are evaluated, in order,
    from left to right.




                                                 65
                                                                              5 Operators and Expressions



       â¢   The ternary selection operator (?:). It operates on three expressions (exp1 ? exp2 : exp3). This
           operator evaluates the first expression, which must result in a scalar Boolean. If the result is true, it
           selects to evaluate the second expression, otherwise it selects to evaluate the third expression. Only
           one of the second and third expressions is evaluated. The second and third expressions can be any
           type, as long their types match. This resulting matching type is the type of the entire expression.
       â¢   The one's complement operator (~). The operand must be of type signed or unsigned integer or integer
           vector, and the result is the one's complement of its operand; each bit of each component is
           complemented, including any sign bits.
       â¢   The shift operators (<<) and (>>). For both operators, the operands must be signed or unsigned
           integers or integer vectors. One operand can be signed while the other is unsigned. In all cases, the
           resulting type will be the same type as the left operand. If the first operand is a scalar, the second
           operand has to be a scalar as well. If the first operand is a vector, the second operand must be a scalar
           or a vector with the same size as the first operand, and the result is computed component-wise. The
           result is undefined if the right operand is negative, or greater than or equal to the number of bits in the
           left expression's base type. The value of E1 << E2 is E1 (interpreted as a bit pattern) left-shifted by
           E2 bits. The value of E1 >> E2 is E1 right-shifted by E2 bit positions. If E1 is a signed integer, the
           right-shift will extend the sign bit. If E1 is an unsigned integer, the right-shift will zero-extend.
       â¢   The bitwise operators and (&), exclusive-or (^), and inclusive-or (|). The operands must be of type
           signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size. If
           one operand is a scalar and the other a vector, the scalar is applied component-wise to the vector,
           resulting in the same type as the vector. The fundamental types of the operands (signed or unsigned)
           must match, and will be the resulting fundamental type. For and (&), the result is the bitwise-and
           function of the operands. For exclusive-or (^), the result is the bitwise exclusive-or function of the
           operands. For inclusive-or (|), the result is the bitwise inclusive-or function of the operands.
       For a complete specification of the syntax of expressions, see section 9 âShading Language Grammar.â

5.10   Vector and Matrix Operations
       With a few exceptions, operations are component-wise. Usually, when an operator operates on a vector or
       matrix, it is operating independently on each component of the vector or matrix, in a component-wise
       fashion. For example,
           vec3 v, u;
           float f;

           v = u + f;

       will be equivalent to
           v.x = u.x + f;
           v.y = u.y + f;
           v.z = u.z + f;

       And
           vec3 v, u, w;
           w = v + u;




                                                        66
                                                                       5 Operators and Expressions



will be equivalent to
   w.x = v.x + u.x;
   w.y = v.y + u.y;
   w.z = v.z + u.z;

and likewise for most operators and all integer and floating point vector and matrix types. The exceptions
are matrix multiplied by vector, vector multiplied by matrix, and matrix multiplied by matrix. These do
not operate component-wise, but rather perform the correct linear algebraic multiply.
   vec3 v, u;
   mat3 m;

   u = v * m;

is equivalent to
   u.x = dot(v, m[0]); // m[0] is the left column of m
   u.y = dot(v, m[1]); // dot(a,b) is the inner (dot) product of a and b
   u.z = dot(v, m[2]);

And
   u = m * v;

is equivalent to
   u.x = m[0].x * v.x          +   m[1].x * v.y          +   m[2].x * v.z;
   u.y = m[0].y * v.x          +   m[1].y * v.y          +   m[2].y * v.z;
   u.z = m[0].z * v.x          +   m[1].z * v.y          +   m[2].z * v.z;

And
   mat3 m, n, r;

   r = m * n;

is equivalent to
   r[0].x = m[0].x * n[0].x             +   m[1].x * n[0].y        +    m[2].x * n[0].z;
   r[1].x = m[0].x * n[1].x             +   m[1].x * n[1].y        +    m[2].x * n[1].z;
   r[2].x = m[0].x * n[2].x             +   m[1].x * n[2].y        +    m[2].x * n[2].z;

   r[0].y = m[0].y * n[0].x             +   m[1].y * n[0].y        +    m[2].y * n[0].z;
   r[1].y = m[0].y * n[1].x             +   m[1].y * n[1].y        +    m[2].y * n[1].z;
   r[2].y = m[0].y * n[2].x             +   m[1].y * n[2].y        +    m[2].y * n[2].z;

   r[0].z = m[0].z * n[0].x             +   m[1].z * n[0].y        +    m[2].z * n[0].z;
   r[1].z = m[0].z * n[1].x             +   m[1].z * n[1].y        +    m[2].z * n[1].z;
   r[2].z = m[0].z * n[2].x             +   m[1].z * n[2].y        +    m[2].z * n[2].z;

and similarly for other sizes of vectors and matrices.

5.11   Evaluation of expressions
       The C++ standard requires that expressions must be evaluated in the order specified by the precedence of
       operations and may only be regrouped if the result is the same or where the result is undefined. No other
       transforms may be applied that affect the result of an operation. GLSL ES relaxes these requirements in
       the following ways:
           â¢    Addition and multiplication are assumed to be associative.
           â¢    Multiplication may be replaced by repeated addition
           â¢    Floating point division may be replaced by reciprocal and multiplication:
           â¢    Within the constraints of invariance (where applicable), the precision used may vary.




                                                     68
6 Statements and Structure

   The fundamental building blocks of the OpenGL ES Shading Language are:
   â¢   statements and declarations
   â¢   function definitions
   â¢   selection (if-else and switch-case-default)
   â¢   iteration (for, while, and do-while)
   â¢   jumps (discard, return, break, and continue)


   The overall structure of a shader is as follows

        translation-unit:
             global-declaration
             translation-unit global-declaration
        global-declaration:
            function-definition
            declaration
   That is, a shader is a sequence of declarations and function bodies. Function bodies are defined as

        function-definition:
             function-prototype { statement-list }
        statement-list:
             statement
             statement-list statement
        statement:
             compound-statement
             simple-statement
   Curly braces are used to group sequences of statements into compound statements.

        compound-statement:
            { statement-list }
        simple-statement:
            declaration-statement
            expression-statement
            selection-statement




                                                     69
                                                                            6 Statements and Structure



                iteration-statement
                jump-statement


      Simple declaration, expression, and jump statements end in a semi-colon.
      This above is slightly simplified, and the complete grammar specified in section 9 âShading Language
      Grammarâ should be used as the definitive specification.
      Declarations and expressions have already been discussed.

6.1   Function Definitions
      As indicated by the grammar above, a valid shader is a sequence of global declarations and function
      definitions. A function is declared as the following example shows:
           // prototype
           returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn);

      and a function is defined like
           // definition
           returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
           {
               // do some computation
               return returnValue;
           }
      where returnType must be present and cannot be void.
      or
           void functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
           {
               // do some computation
               return; // optional
           }

      . Each of the typeN must include a type and can optionally include a parameter qualifier and/or const.
      A function is called by using its name followed by a list of arguments in parentheses.
      Arrays are allowed as arguments and as the return type. In both cases, the array must be explicitly sized.
      An array is passed or returned by using just its name, without brackets, and the size of the array must
      match the size specified in the function's declaration.
      Structures are also allowed as argument types. The return type can also be a structure.
      See section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive reference on the syntax to declare and
      define functions.
      All functions must be either declared with a prototype or defined with a body before they are called. For
      example:




                                                     70
                                                                       6 Statements and Structure



   float myfunc (float f,                    // f is an input parameter
                 out float g);               // g is an output parameter


Functions that return no value must be declared as void. A void function can only use return without a
return argument, even if the return argument has void type. Return statements only accept values:
   void func1() { }
   void func2() { return func1(); } // illegal return statement

Only a precision qualifier is allowed on the return type of a function. Formal parameters can have
parameter and precision qualifiers, but no other qualifiers.
Functions that accept no input arguments need not use void in the argument list because prototypes (or
definitions) are required and therefore there is no ambiguity when an empty argument list "( )" is declared.
The idiom â(void)â as a parameter list is provided for convenience.
Function names can be overloaded. The same function name can be used for multiple functions, as long
as the parameter types differ. If a function name is declared twice with the same parameter types, then the
return types and all qualifiers must also match, and it is the same function being declared. When function
calls are resolved, an exact type match for all the arguments is required.
For example,
   vec4   f(in vec4 x, out vec4           y);
   vec4   f(in vec4 x, out ivec4          y); // allowed, different argument type
   int    f(in vec4 x, out ivec4          y); // error, only return type differs
   vec4   f(in vec4 x, in ivec4           y); // error, only qualifier differs
   int    f(const in vec4 x, out          ivec4 y); // error, only qualifier differs

Calling the first two functions above with the following argument types yields
   f(vec4, vec4)          //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y)
   f(vec4, ivec4)         //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out ivec4 y)
   f(ivec4, vec4)         //   error, no exact match.
   f(ivec4, ivec4)        //   error, no exact match.

User-defined functions can have multiple declarations, but only one definition.
A shader cannot redefine or overload built-in functions.
The function main is used as the entry point to a shader executable. Both the vertex and fragment shaders
must define a function named main. This function takes no arguments, returns no value, and must be
declared as type void:
   void main()
   {
       ...
   }

The function main can contain uses of return. See section 6.4 âJumpsâ for more details.
It is an error to declare or define a function main with any other parameters or return type.

                                                                                  6 Statements and Structure



6.1.1   Function Calling Conventions
        Functions are called by value-return. This means input arguments are copied into the function at call time,
        and output arguments are copied back to the caller before function exit. Because the function works with
        local copies of parameters, there are no issues regarding aliasing of variables within a function. To
        control what parameters are copied in and/or out through a function definition or declaration:
        â¢   The keyword in is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied in, but not copied out.
        â¢   The keyword out is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied out, but not copied in.
            This should be used whenever possible to avoid unnecessarily copying parameters in.
        â¢   The keyword inout is used as a qualifier to denote the parameter is to be both copied in and copied
            out.
        â¢   A function parameter declared with no such qualifier means the same thing as specifying in.
        All arguments are evaluated at call time, exactly once, in order, from left to right. Evaluation of an in
        parameter results in a value that is copied to the formal parameter. Evaluation of an out parameter results
        in an l-value that is used to copy out a value when the function returns. Evaluation of an inout parameter
        results in both a value and an l-value; the value is copied to the formal parameter at call time and the l-
        value is used to copy out a value when the function returns.
        The order in which output parameters are copied back to the caller is undefined.
        In a function, writing to an input-only parameter is allowed. Only the functionâs copy is modified. This
        can be prevented by declaring a parameter with the const qualifier.
        When calling a function, expressions that do not evaluate to l-values cannot be passed to parameters
        declared as out or inout.
        No qualifier is allowed on the return type of a function.

             function-prototype:
                  precision-qualifier type function-name(const-qualifier parameter-qualifier precision-qualifier
                  type name array-specifier, ... )
             type:
                     any basic type, array type, structure name, or structure definition
             const-qualifier:
                  empty
                  const
             parameter-qualifier:
                 empty
                 in
                 out
                 inout
             name:
                 empty




                                                          72
                                                                               6 Statements and Structure

           array-specifier:
                empty
                [ constant-integral-expression ]


      However, the const qualifier cannot be used with out or inout. The above is used for function
      declarations (i.e., prototypes) and for function definitions. Hence, function definitions can have unnamed
      arguments.
      Static and dynamic recursion is not allowed. Static recursion is present if the static function call graph of
      the program contains cycles. Dynamic recursion occurs if at any time control flow has entered but not
      exited a single function more than once.

6.2   Selection
      Conditional control flow in the shading language is done by either if, if-else, or switch statements:
           selection-statement:
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement else statement
                 switch ( init-expression ) { switch-statement-listopt }
      Where switch-statement-list is a list of zero or more switch-statement and other statements defined by the
      language, where switch-statement adds some forms of labels. That is
           switch-statement-list:
                switch-statement
                switch-statement-list switch-statement
           switch-statement:
                case constant-expression:
                default :
                statement

      If an if-expression evaluates to true, then the first statement is executed. If it evaluates to false and there
      is an else part then the second statement is executed.
      Any expression whose type evaluates to a Boolean can be used as the conditional expression bool-
      expression. Vector types are not accepted as the expression to if.
      Conditionals can be nested.




                                                       73
                                                                              6 Statements and Structure



      The type of init-expression in a switch statement must be a scalar integer. If a case label has a constant-
      expression of equal value, then execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, if there is a default
      label, execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, execution skips the rest of the switch statement.
      It is an error to have more than one default or a replicated constant-expression. A break statement not
      nested in a loop or other switch statement (either not nested or nested only in if or if-else statements) will
      also skip the rest of the switch statement. Fall through labels are allowed, but it is an error to have no
      statement between a label and the end of the switch statement. No statements are allowed in a switch
      statement before the first case statement.
      The type of init-expression must match the type of the case labels within each switch statement. Either
      signed integers or unsigned integers are allowed but there is no implicit type conversion between the two.
      No case or default labels can be nested inside other control flow nested within their corresponding
      switch.

6.3   Iteration
      For, while, and do loops are allowed as follows:
          for (init-expression; condition-expression; loop-expression)
              sub-statement

          while (condition-expression)
              sub-statement

          do
              statement
          while (condition-expression)

      See section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive specification of loops.
      The for loop first evaluates the init-expression, then the condition-expression. If the condition-
      expression evaluates to true, then the body of the loop is executed. After the body is executed, a for loop
      will then evaluate the loop-expression, and then loop back to evaluate the condition-expression, repeating
      until the condition-expression evaluates to false. The loop is then exited, skipping its body and skipping
      its loop-expression. Variables modified by the loop-expression maintain their value after the loop is
      exited, provided they are still in scope. Variables declared in init-expression or condition-expression are
      only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the for loop.
      The while loop first evaluates the condition-expression. If true, then the body is executed. This is then
      repeated, until the condition-expression evaluates to false, exiting the loop and skipping its body.
      Variables declared in the condition-expression are only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the
      while loop.
      For both for and while loops, the sub-statement does not introduce a new scope for variable names, so the
      following has a redeclaration error:

          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
              int i; // redeclaration error
      }




                                                      74
                                                                             6 Statements and Structure



      The do-while loop first executes the body, then executes the condition-expression. This is repeated until
      condition-expression evaluates to false, and then the loop is exited.
      Expressions for condition-expression must evaluate to a Boolean.
      Both the condition-expression and the init-expression can declare and initialize a variable, except in the
      do-while loop, which cannot declare a variable in its condition-expression. The variableâs scope lasts
      only until the end of the sub-statement that forms the body of the loop.
      Loops can be nested.
      Non-terminating loops are allowed. The consequences of very long or non-terminating loops are platform
      dependent.

6.4   Jumps
      These are the jumps:

           jump_statement:
               continue;
               break;
               return;
               return expression;
               discard;    // in the fragment shader language only


      There is no âgotoâ nor other non-structured flow of control.
      The continue jump is used only in loops. It skips the remainder of the body of the innermost loop of
      which it is inside. For while and do-while loops, this jump is to the next evaluation of the loop
      condition-expression from which the loop continues as previously defined. For for loops, the jump is to
      the loop-expression, followed by the condition-expression.
      The break jump can also be used only in loops and switch statements. It is simply an immediate exit of
      the inner-most loop or switch statements containing the break. No further execution of condition-
      expression, loop-expression, or switch-statement is done.
      The discard keyword is only allowed within fragment shaders. It can be used within a fragment shader to
      abandon the operation on the current fragment. This keyword causes the fragment to be discarded and no
      updates to any buffers will occur. Control flow exits the shader, and subsequent implicit or explicit
      derivatives are undefined when this control flow is non-uniform (meaning different fragments within the
      primitive take different control paths). It would typically be used within a conditional statement, for
      example:
         if (intensity < 0.0)
             discard;

      A fragment shader may test a fragmentâs alpha value and discard the fragment based on that test.
      However, it should be noted that coverage testing occurs after the fragment shader runs, and the coverage
      test can change the alpha value.




                                                     75
                                                                      6 Statements and Structure



The return jump causes immediate exit of the current function. If it has expression then that is the return
value for the function.
The function main can use return. This simply causes main to exit in the same way as when the end of
the function had been reached. It does not imply a use of discard in a fragment shader. Using return in
main before defining outputs will have the same behavior as reaching the end of main before defining
outputs.

7 Built-in Variables

7.1   Vertex Shader Special Variables
      Some OpenGL ES operations occur in fixed functionality between the vertex processor and the fragment
      processor. Shaders communicate with the fixed functionality of OpenGL ES through the use of built-in
      variables.
      The built-in vertex shader variables for communicating with fixed functionality are intrinsically declared
      as follows in the vertex language:
         in highp int gl_VertexID;
         in highp int gl_InstanceID;

         out highp vec4 gl_Position;
         out highp float gl_PointSize;

      Unless otherwise noted elsewhere, these variables are only available in the vertex language as declared
      above.
      The variable gl_Position is intended for writing the homogeneous vertex position. It can be written at any
      time during shader execution. This value will be used by primitive assembly, clipping, culling, and other
      fixed functionality operations, if present, that operate on primitives after vertex processing has occurred.
      Its value is undefined after the vertex processing stage if the vertex shader executable does not write
      gl_Position.
      The variable gl_PointSize is intended for a shader to write the size of the point to be rasterized. It is
      measured in pixels. If gl_PointSize is not written to, its value is undefined in subsequent pipe stages.
      The variable gl_VertexID is a vertex shader input variable that holds an integer index for the vertex, as
      defined under âShader Inputsâ in section 2.11.9 âShader Executionâ in the OpenGL ES Graphics System
      Specification. While the variable gl_VertexID is always present, its value is not always defined.
      The variable gl_InstanceID is a vertex shader input variable that holds the instance number of the current
      primitive in an instanced draw call (see âShader Inputsâ in section 2.11.9 âShader Executionâ in the
      OpenGL ES 3.0 Graphics System Specification). If the current primitive does not come from an instanced
      draw call, the value of gl_InstanceID is zero.




                                                     77
                                                                                            7 Built-in Variables



7.2   Fragment Shader Special Variables
      The built-in special variables that are accessible from a fragment shader are intrinsically declared as
      follows:
         in    highp   vec4           gl_FragCoord;
         in    bool                   gl_FrontFacing;
         out   highp   float          gl_FragDepth;
         in    mediump vec2           gl_PointCoord;

      Except as noted below, they behave as other input and output variables.
      The output of the fragment shader executable is processed by the fixed function operations at the back end
      of the OpenGL ES pipeline.
      The fixed functionality computed depth for a fragment may be obtained by reading gl_FragCoord.z,
      described below.
      Writing to gl_FragDepth will establish the depth value for the fragment being processed. If depth
      buffering is enabled, and no shader writes gl_FragDepth, then the fixed function value for depth will be
      used as the fragmentâs depth value. If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragDepth, and there is an
      execution path through the shader that does not set gl_FragDepth, then the value of the fragmentâs depth
      may be undefined for executions of the shader that take that path. That is, if the set of linked fragment
      shaders statically contain a write to gl_FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.
      If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and the values of any user-defined
      fragment outputs, become irrelevant.
      The variable gl_FragCoord is available as an input variable from within fragment shaders and it holds the
      window relative coordinates (x, y, z, 1/w) values for the fragment. If multi-sampling, this value can be for
      any location within the pixel, or one of the fragment samples. The use of centroid in does not further
      restrict this value to be inside the current primitive. This value is the result of the fixed functionality that
      interpolates primitives after vertex processing to generate fragments. The z component is the depth value
      that would be used for the fragmentâs depth if no shader contained any writes to gl_FragDepth. This is
      useful for invariance if a shader conditionally computes gl_FragDepth but otherwise wants the fixed
      functionality fragment depth.
      Fragment shaders have access to the input built-in variable gl_FrontFacing, whose value is true if the
      fragment belongs to a front-facing primitive. One use of this is to emulate two-sided lighting by selecting
      one of two colors calculated by a vertex shader.
      The values in gl_PointCoord are two-dimensional coordinates indicating where within a point primitive
      the current fragment is located, when point sprites are enabled. They range from 0.0 to 1.0 across the
      point. If the current primitive is not a point, or if point sprites are not enabled, then the values read from
      gl_PointCoord are undefined.

7.3   Built-In Constants
      The following built-in constants are provided to all shaders. The actual values used are implementation
      dependent, but must be at least the value shown.
         //

         // Implementation dependent constants. The example values below
         // are the minimum values allowed for these maximums.
         //

         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxVertexAttribs = 16;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxVertexUniformVectors = 256;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxVertexOutputVectors = 16;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxFragmentInputVectors = 15;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxVertexTextureImageUnits = 16;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxCombinedTextureImageUnits = 32;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxTextureImageUnits = 16;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxFragmentUniformVectors = 224;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxDrawBuffers = 4;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MinProgramTexelOffset = -8;
         const   mediump    int    gl_MaxProgramTexelOffset = 7;


7.4   Built-In Uniform State
      As an aid to accessing OpenGL ES processing state, the following uniform variables are built into the
      OpenGL ES Shading Language.
         //
         // Depth range in window coordinates,
         // section 2.13.1 âControlling the Viewportâ in the
         // OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification.
         //
         struct gl_DepthRangeParameters {
             highp float near;        // n
             highp float far;         // f
             highp float diff;        // f - n
         };
         uniform gl_DepthRangeParameters gl_DepthRange;




                                                    79
8 Built-in Functions

   The OpenGL ES Shading Language defines an assortment of built-in convenience functions for scalar and
   vector operations. Many of these built-in functions can be used in more than one type of shader, but some
   are intended to provide a direct mapping to hardware and so are available only for a specific type of
   shader.
   The built-in functions basically fall into three categories:
   â¢   They expose some necessary hardware functionality in a convenient way such as accessing a texture
       map. There is no way in the language for these functions to be emulated by a shader.
   â¢   They represent a trivial operation (clamp, mix, etc.) that is very simple for the user to write, but they
       are very common and may have direct hardware support. It is a very hard problem for the compiler to
       map expressions to complex assembler instructions.
   â¢   They represent an operation graphics hardware is likely to accelerate at some point. The trigonometry
       functions fall into this category.
   Many of the functions are similar to the same named ones in common C libraries, but they support vector
   input as well as the more traditional scalar input.
   Applications should be encouraged to use the built-in functions rather than do the equivalent computations
   in their own shader code since the built-in functions are assumed to be optimal (e.g., perhaps supported
   directly in hardware).
   When the built-in functions are specified below, where the input arguments (and corresponding output)
   can be float, vec2, vec3, or vec4, genType is used as the argument. Where the input arguments (and
   corresponding output) can be int, ivec2, ivec3, or ivec4, genIType is used as the argument. Where the
   input arguments (and corresponding output) can be uint, uvec2, uvec3, or uvec4, genUType is used as the
   argument. Where the input arguments (or corresponding output) can be bool, bvec2, bvec3, or bvec4,
   genBType is used as the argument. For any specific use of a function, the actual types substituted for
   genType, genIType, genUType, or genBType have to have the same number of components for all
   arguments and for the return type. Similarly for mat, which can be any matrix basic type.
   The precision of built-in functions is dependent on the function and arguments. There are three
   categories:
   â¢   Some functions have predefined precisions. The precision is specified
       e.g.
       highp ivec2 textureSize (gsampler2D sampler, int lod)
   â¢   For the texture sampling functions, the precision of the return type matches the precision of the
       sampler type.

       uniform lowp sampler2D sampler;
       highp vec2 coord;
       ...
       lowp vec4 col = texture (sampler, coord); // texture() returns lowp

â¢   For other built-in functions, a call will return a precision qualification matching the highest precision
    qualification of the call's input arguments. See Section 4.5.2 âPrecision Qualifiersâ for more detail.
The built-in functions are assumed to be implemented according to the equations specified in the
following sections. The precision at which the calculations are performed follows the general rules for
precision of operations as specified in section 4.5.3 âPrecision Qualifiersâ.
Example:



               ()                    ()
              x      1     x
    normalize y = 2 2 2 y
              z â x + y +z z
If the input vector is lowp, the entire calculation is performed at lowp. For some inputs, this will cause the
calculation to overflow, even when the correct result is within the range of lowp.

8.1   Angle and Trigonometry Functions
      Function parameters specified as angle are assumed to be in units of radians. In no case will any of these
      functions result in a divide by zero error. If the divisor of a ratio is 0, then results will be undefined.
      These all operate component-wise. The description is per component.

              genBType a)                 corresponding component of x is returned. For a

genType smoothstep (float edge0,          you would want a threshold function with a smooth
                   float edge1,           transition. This is equivalent to:
                   genType x)
                                              genType t;

8.8   Texture Lookup Functions
      Texture lookup functions are available to vertex and fragment shaders. However, level of detail is not
      implicitly computed for vertex shaders. The functions in the table below provide access to textures
      through samplers, as set up through the OpenGL ES API. Texture properties such as size, pixel format,
      number of dimensions, filtering method, number of mip-map levels, depth comparison, and so on are also
      defined by OpenGL ES API calls. Such properties are taken into account as the texture is accessed via the
      built-in functions defined below.
      Texture data can be stored by the GL as floating point, unsigned normalized integer, unsigned integer or
      signed integer data. This is determined by the type of the internal format of the texture. Texture lookups
      on unsigned normalized integer and floating point data return floating point values in the range [0, 1].
      Texture lookup functions are provided that can return their result as floating point, unsigned integer or
      signed integer, depending on the sampler type passed to the lookup function. Care must be taken to use
      the right sampler type for texture access. The following table lists the supported combinations of sampler
      types and texture internal formats. Blank entries are unsupported. Doing a texture lookup will return
      undefined values for unsupported combinations.


                                        Floating Point      Signed Integer       Unsigned Integer

            Floating point                  Supported
            Normalized Integer              Supported
            Signed Integer                                       Supported
            Unsigned Integer                                                         Supported


      If an integer sampler type is used, the result of a texture lookup is an ivec4. If an unsigned integer
      sampler type is used, the result of a texture lookup is a uvec4. If a floating point sampler type is used, the
      result of a texture lookup is a vec4, where each component is in the range [0, 1].
      In the prototypes below, the âgâ in the return type âgvec4â is used as a placeholder for nothing, âiâ, or âuâ
      making a return type of vec4, ivec4, or uvec4. In these cases, the sampler argument type also starts with
      âgâ, indicating the same substitution done on the return type; it is either a floating point, signed integer, or
      unsigned integer sampler, matching the basic type of the return type, as described above.
      For shadow forms (the sampler parameter is a shadow-type), a depth comparison lookup on the depth
      texture bound to sampler is done as described in section 3.8.16 âTexture Comparison Modesâ of the
      OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification. See the table below for which component specifies Dref. The
      texture bound to sampler must be a depth texture, or results are undefined. If a non-shadow texture call is
      made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth comparisons turned on, then results are
      undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth
      comparisons turned off, then results are undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that does
      not represent a depth texture, then results are undefined.

In all functions below, the bias parameter is optional for fragment shaders. The bias parameter is not
accepted in a vertex shader. For a fragment shader, if bias is present, it is added to the implicit level of
detail prior to performing the texture access operation.
The implicit level of detail is selected as follows: For a texture that is not mip-mapped, the texture is used
directly. If it is mip-mapped and running in a fragment shader, the LOD computed by the implementation
is used to do the texture lookup. If it is mip-mapped and running on the vertex shader, then the base
texture is used.
Some texture functions (non-âLodâ and non-âGradâ versions) may require implicit derivatives. Implicit
derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow and for vertex texture fetches.
For Cube forms, the direction of P is used to select which face to do a 2-dimensional texture lookup in, as
described in section 3.8.10 âCube Map Texture Selectionâ in the OpenGL ES Graphics System
Specification.
For Array forms, the array layer used will be
  max î0,min îd â1, floorîlayerî0.5îîî
where d is the depth of the texture array and layer comes from the component indicated in the tables
below.

8.9   Fragment Processing Functions
      Fragment processing functions are only available in fragment shaders.
      Derivatives may be computationally expensive and/or numerically unstable. Therefore, an OpenGL ES
      implementation may approximate the true derivatives by using a fast but not entirely accurate derivative
      computation. Derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow.
      The expected behavior of a derivative is specified using forward/backward differencing.




                                                    99
                                                                                  8 Built-in Functions



Forward differencing:
     F î xîdx îâF î xî ~ dFdx î xîâdx         1a
                  F î xîdx îâF î xî
    dFdx î xî ~                               1b
                         dx


Backward differencing:
    F î xâdx îâF î xî ~ âdFdx î xîâdx         2a
                  F î xîâF îxâdxî
    dFdx î xî ~                               2b
                         dx


With single-sample rasterization, dx <= 1.0 in equations 1b and 2b. For multi-sample rasterization, dx <
2.0 in equations 1b and 2b.
dFdy is approximated similarly, with y replacing x.
An OpenGL ES implementation may use the above or other methods to perform the calculation, subject to
the following conditions:
1. The method may use piecewise linear approximations. Such linear approximations imply that higher
   order derivatives, dFdx(dFdx(x)) and above, are undefined.
2. The method may assume that the function evaluated is continuous. Therefore derivatives within the
   body of a non-uniform conditional are undefined.
3. The method may differ per fragment, subject to the constraint that the method may vary by window
   coordinates, not screen coordinates. The invariance requirement described in section 3.2 âInvarianceâ
   of the OpenGL ES Graphics System Specification, is relaxed for derivative calculations, because the
   method may be a function of fragment location.
Other properties that are desirable, but not required, are:
4. Functions should be evaluated within the interior of a primitive (interpolated, not extrapolated).
5. Functions for dFdx should be evaluated while holding y constant. Functions for dFdy should be
   evaluated while holding x constant. However, mixed higher order derivatives, like dFdx(dFdy(y))
   and dFdy(dFdx(x)) are undefined.
6. Derivatives of constant arguments should be 0.
In some implementations, varying degrees of derivative accuracy may be obtained by providing GL hints
(section 5.3 âHintsâ of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Graphics System Specification), allowing a user to make an
image quality versus speed trade off.

                                                               8 Built-in Functions



Syntax                         Description
genType dFdx (genType p)      Returns the derivative in x using local differencing for
                              the input argument p.


genType dFdy (genType p)      Returns the derivative in y using local differencing for
                              the input argument p.

                              These two functions are commonly used to estimate the
                              filter width used to anti-alias procedural textures. We
                              are assuming that the expression is being evaluated in
                              parallel on a SIMD array so that at any given point in
                              time the value of the function is known at the grid points
                              represented by the SIMD array. Local differencing
                              between SIMD array elements can therefore be used to
                              derive dFdx, dFdy, etc.

genType fwidth (genType p)    Returns the sum of the absolute derivative in x and y
                              using local differencing for the input argument p, i.e.,
                              abs (dFdx (p)) + abs (dFdy (p));

In general the above grammar describes a super set of the GLSL ES language. Certain constructs that are
valid purely in terms of the grammar are disallowed by statements elsewhere in this specification.
Rules specifying the scoping are present only to assist the understanding of scoping and they do not affect
the language accepted by the grammar. If required, the grammar can be simplified by making the
following substitutions:
    â¢      Replace compound_statement_with_scope and compound_statement_no_new_scope with a new
           rule compound_statement
    â¢      Replace statement_with_scope and statement_no_new_scope with the existing rule statement.

10 Errors

       This section lists errors that must be detected by the compiler or linker. Development systems must
       report all grammatical errors are compile time but otherwise, it is implementation-dependent whether an
       error is reported at compile time or link time and there is no guarantee of consistency.
       The error string returned is implementation-dependent.

11 Counting of Inputs and Outputs

   This section applies to vertex shader outputs and fragment shader inputs.
   GLSL ES 3.0 specifies the storage available for vertex shader outputs and fragment shader inputs in terms
   of an array of 4-vectors. The assumption is that variables will be packed into these arrays without wasting
   space. This places significant burden on implementations since optimal packing is computationally
   intensive. Implementations may have more internal resources than exposed to the application and so
   avoid the need to perform packing but this is also considered an expensive solution.
   GLSL ES 3.0 therefore relaxes the requirements for packing by specifying a simpler algorithm that may
   be used. This algorithm specifies a minimum requirement for when a set of variables must be supported
   by an implementation. The implementation is allowed to support more than the minimum and so may use
   a more efficient algorithm and/or may support more registers than the virtual target machine.
   In all cases, failing resource allocation for variables must result in an error.
   The resource allocation of variables must succeed for all cases where the following packing algorithm
   succeeds:
       â¢    The target architecture consists of a grid of registers, 16 rows by 4 columns for vertex output and
            fragment input variables. Each register can contain a float value.
       â¢    Variables are packed into the registers one at a time so that they each occupy a contiguous sub-
            rectangle. No splitting of variables is permitted.
       â¢    The orientation of variables is fixed. Vectors always occupy registers in a single row. Elements
            of an array must be in different rows. E.g. vec4 will always occupy one row; float[16] will
            occupy one column. Since it is not permitted to split a variable, large arrays e.g. float[32] will
            always fail with this algorithm.
       â¢    Non-square matrices of type matCxR consume the same space as a square matrix of type matN
            where N is the greater of C and R. Variables of type mat2 occupies 2 complete rows. These
            rules allow implementations more flexibility in how variables are stored.
            Other variables consume only the minimum space required.
       â¢    Arrays of size N are assumed to take N times the size of the base type.




                                                   119
                                                         11 Counting of Inputs and Outputs



â¢   Variables are packed in the following order:
      1.   Arrays of mat4 and mat4
      2.   Arrays of mat2 and mat2 (since they occupy full rows)
      3.   Arrays of vec4 and vec4
      4.   Arrays of mat3 and mat3
      5.   Arrays of vec3 and vec3
      6.   Arrays of vec2 and vec2
      7.   Arrays of float and float
â¢   For each of the above types, the arrays are processed in order of size, largest first. Arrays of size
    1 and the base type are considered equivalent. The first type to be packed will be mat4[4],
    mat4[3], mat[2] followed by mat4, mat2[4]...mat2[2], mat2, vec4[8], ve4[7],...vec4[1], vec4,
    mat3[2], mat3 and so on. The last variables to be packed will be float (and float[1]).
â¢   For 2,3 and 4 component variables packing is started using the 1st column of the 1st row.
    Variables are then allocated to successive rows, aligning them to the 1st column.
â¢   For 2 component variables, when there are no spare rows, the strategy is switched to using the
    highest numbered row and the lowest numbered column where the variable will fit. (In practice,
    this means they will be aligned to the x or z component.) Packing of any further 3 or 4
    component variables will fail at this point.
â¢   1 component variables (i.e. floats and arrays of floats) have their own packing rule. They are
    packed in order of size, largest first. Each variable is placed in the column that leaves the least
    amount of space in the column and aligned to the lowest available rows within that column.
    During this phase of packing, space will be available in up to 4 columns. The space within each
    column is always contiguous.
â¢   If at any time the packing of a variable fails, the compiler or linker must report an error.

Example: pack the following types:
   out   vec4 a;              //     top left
   out   mat3 b;              //     align to left, lowest numbered rows
   out   mat2x3 c;            //     same size as mat3, align to left
   out   vec2 d[6];           //     align to left, lowest numbered rows
   out   vec2 e[4];           //     Cannot align to left so align to z column, highest
                              //     numbered rows
   out vec2 f;                //     Align to left, lowest numbered rows.
   out float g[3]             //     Column with minimum space
   out float h[2];            //     Column with minimum space (choice of 3, any
                              //     can be used)
   out float i;               //     Column with minimum space

In this example, the variables happen to be listed in the order in which they are packed. Packing is
independent of the order of declaration.

Some types e.g. mat4[8] will be too large to fit. These always fail with this algorithm.
If referenced in the fragment shader (after preprocessing), the built-in special variables (gl_FragCoord,
gl_FrontFacing and gl_PointCoord) are included when calculating the storage requirements of fragment
inputs.

Vertex outputs and fragment inputs are counted separately. They are only counted if they are statically
used within the shader.

12 Issues

12.1   Compatibility with OpenGL ES 2.0
       How should OpenGL ES 3.0 support shaders written for OpenGL ES 2.0?
       Option 1: Retain all GLSL ES 1.0 constructs in the new language.
       Option 2: Allow GLSL ES 1.0 shaders to run in the OpenGL ES 3.0 API.
       RESOLUTION: Option 2. This minimizes the complexity of the language with only a small increase in
       system complexity. It also leaves open the option of deprecating the old language in future versions of the
       API.

12.2   Convergence with OpenGL
       How much should GLSL ES be influenced by the GLSL specification?
       OpenGL ES 3.0 is principally targeted at mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. As such, it is
       expected that the major use-cases will include gaming and user-interfaces. It is to be expected that
       content will be ported to and from desktop devices.
       RESOLUTION: In the absence of any other requirements, GLSL ES 3.0 should follow GLSL 3.3. The
       main exceptions to this are:
           â¢    The specification should adhere to the principle that functionality should not be duplicated.
           â¢    Functionality specific to mobile devices (such as reduced precision) can be added.
           â¢    Improvements found in later versions of GLSL can be considered for inclusion.

12.3   Numeric Precision
       Should the Open GL ES 2.0 precision requirements be increased?
       Most current implementations support a subset of IEEE 754 32-bit floating point. Many implementations
       also support reduced precision.
       RESOLUTIONS:
           â¢    highp float should be specified as a subset of IEEE 754 floating point.
           â¢    highp int should be exactly 32 bits.
           â¢    lowp and mediump should be retained. Mediump to have increased precision.


       Should there be a defined format for mediump?
       Option: Yes, this would increase portability and encourage the use of mediump on mobile devices.




                                                       123
                                                                                                      12 Issues



       Option: No, this would be expensive to implement on devices that do not natively support it.
       RESOLUTION: No. The specification should allow efficient implementation of mediump float on 16-bit
       floating point hardware but must also be implementable on devices which only natively support 32-bit
       floating point.


       Should the fragment shader have a default precision?
       Vertex shaders have a default high precision because lower precisions are not sufficient for the majority of
       graphics applications. However, many fragment shader operations do not benefit from high precision and
       developers should be encouraged to use lower precision where possible as this may increases performance
       or reduce power consumption. In particular, blend operations normally only require low precision and
       many texture address calculations can be performed at medium precision.
       However OpenGL ES may also be used in higher performance devices where the benefit is limited.
       Therefore there appears to be no single precision that would be applicable to all situations.
       RESOLUTION: No, there will be no default precision for fragment shaders.

12.4   Floating Point Representation and Functionality
       Should IEEE 754 representation be mandated?
       The internal format used by an implementation might not be visible to an application so it is meaningless
       to specify this. Certain functionality IEEE 754 must be present though.
       RESOLUTION: In general, highp float must behave as if it is in IEEE 754 format.


       Which features should be mandated?
       Most of the IEEE 754 is relatively inexpensive to implement given that 32-bit floating point is a
       requirement. However some implementations do not implement signed zeros, rounding modes and NaNs
       because of hardware cost. In addition, there are certain compiler optimizations that the IEEE 745
       specification prohibits.
       RESOLUTION: Mandate support of signed infinities. Support of signed zeros, NaNs.


       Should the support of NaNs be consistent?
       Should the specification allow either full IEEE NaN support or no support but nothing in between?
       RESOLUTION: No, implementations may have partial support and there is no guarantee of consistency.
       The only requirement is that isnan() must return false if NaNs are not supported.


       Should subnormal numbers (also known as 'denorms') be supported?
       RESOLUTION: No, subnormal numbers maybe flushed to zero at any time.




                                                     124
                                                                                                       12 Issues



       How should the rounding mode be specified?
       Most current implementations support round-to-nearest. Some but not all also support round-to-nearest-
       even.
       RESOLUTION: Within the accuracy specification, the rounding mode should be undefined.


       Should there be general invariance rules for numeric formats and operations?
       The GLSL ES specification allows the implementation a degree of flexibility. Consequently the results of
       a computation may be different on different implementations. However, it is not stated whether a single
       implementation is allowed to vary the results of a given computation, either in different shaders or
       different parts of the same shader. OpenGL has a general invariance rule that prevents the results of a
       computation varying if no state (including the choice of shader) is unchanged.
       RESOLUTION: Operations and formats are in general considered to be variant.

12.5   Precision Qualifiers
       Should the precisions be specified as float16, float32 etc.? This would help portability. It implies
       different types rather than hints. It will require all implementations to use the same or similar algorithms
       and reduces the scope for innovation.
       RESOLUTION: No, the precision should not specify a format. Standardized arithmetic is not (yet) a
       requirement for graphics.


       Do integers have precision qualifiers? OpenGL ES 3.0 hardware is expected to have native integer
       support and some implementations may have reduced precision available.
       RESOLUTION: Yes, integers have precision qualifiers.


       How should wrapping behavior of integers be defined? If an application relies on wrapping on one
       implementation this may cause portability problems.
       Option: The standard should specify either wrapping or clamping. This allows for maximum
       implementation flexibility.
       Option: Mandate wrapping. There is a trend towards more complex shaders and developers will expect
       integers to behave as in C++.
       RESOLUTION: Mandate wrapping.


       Are precision qualifiers available in the vertex shader?
       RESOLUTION: Yes. Reduced precision may be available in the vertex shader in some implementations
       and it keeps the languages consistent.




                                                      125
                                                                                                 12 Issues



Should different precisions create different types and e.g. require explicit conversion between them?
Option1: No, they are just hints. But hinting high precision is meaningless if the implementation can
ignore it.
Option 2: Yes they are different types. But this introduces complexity.
RESOLUTION: The precision qualifier can significantly affect behavior in many implementations.
highp means 32-bit IEEE 743 floating point is used but mediump means that at least medium precision is
used (and similarly for lowp) so precision qualifiers are more than just hints. As far as the language is
concerned it doesn't affect the behavior so they can either be considered as hints or as different types with
implicit type conversion. In any case, implementations are free to calculate everything at high precision.


Should precisions be considered when resolving function calls?
RESOLUTION: No, they should be considered more as hints. Function declarations cannot be
overloaded based on precision.


How should precisions be propagated in an expression?
Option 1: Only consider the inputs to an operation. For operands that have no defined precision,
determination of precision starts at the leaf nodes of the expression tree and proceeds to the root until the
precision is found. If necessary this includes the l-value in an assignment. Constant expressions must be
invariant and it is expected that they will be evaluated at compile time. Therefore they must be evaluated
at the highest precision (either lowp or highp) supported by the target, or above.
Option 2: Always take the target of the expression into account. The compiler should be able to work out
how to avoid losing precision.
RESOLUTION: Option 1. This makes it easier for the developer to specify which precisions are used in
a complex expression.


What if there is no precision in an expression?
Option 1: Leave this as undefined.
Option 2: Use the default precision.
RESOLUTION: Use the default precision. It is an error if this is not defined (in the fragment shader).


Do precision qualifiers for uniforms need to match?
Option 1: Yes.
Uniforms are defined to behave as if they are using the same storage in the vertex and fragment processors
and may be implemented this way.
If uniforms are used in both the vertex and fragment shaders, developers should be warned if the
precisions are different. Conversion of precision should never be implicit.




                                               126
                                                                                               12 Issues



Option 2: No.
Uniforms may be used by both shaders but the same precision may not be available in both so there is a
justification for allowing them to be different.
Using the same uniform in the vertex and fragment shaders will always require the precision to be
specified in the vertex shader (since the default precision is highp). This is an unnecessary burden on
developers.
RESOLUTION: Yes, precision qualifiers for uniforms must match.


Do precision qualifiers for vertex outputs and the corresponding fragment inputs (previously known as
'varyings') need to match?
Option 1: Yes. Varyings are written by the vertex shader and read by the fragment shader so there are no
situations where the precision needs to be different.
Option 2: No, the vertex outputs written by the vertex shader should not be considered to be the same
variables as those read by the fragment shader (there can be no shared storage). Hence they can be
specified to have different precisions.
RESOLUTION Precision qualifiers for vertex outputs and fragment inputs do not need to match.


lowp int
lowp float has a range of +/- 2.0 but lowp int has a range of +/- 256. This becomes problematic if
conversion form lowp float to lowp int is required. Direct conversion i.e. lowp int = int(lowp float)
loses almost all the precision and multiplying before conversion e.g. lowp int = int(lowp float * 256)
causes an overflow and hence an undefined result. The only way to maintain precision is to first convert
to mediump float.
Option 1: Keep this behavior. Accept that conversion of lowp float to low int loses precision and is
therefore not useful.
Options 2: Make lowp int consistent with mediump and highp int by setting its range to +/- 1
Options 3: Redefine the conversion of lowp float to lowp int to include an 8-bit left shift. The
conversion of lowp int to lowp float then contains an 8-bit right shift.
Option 4: Option 1 but add built-in functions to shift-convert between the two formats.
Option 5: Redefine the lowp float to be a true floating point format. It would then be equivalent to a
floating point value with a 10 bit mantissa and a 3 bit unsigned exponent.
RESOLUTION: Option 1 Conversion will lose most of the precision.


Precision of built-in texture functions.




                                              127
                                                                                                        12 Issues



       Most built-in functions take a single parameter and it is sensible for the precision of the return value to be
       the same as the precision of the parameter. The texture functions take sampler and coordinate parameters.
       The return value should be completely independent of the precision of the coordinates. How should the
       precision of the return value be specified?
       RESOLUTION: Allow sampler types to take a precision qualifier. The return value of the texture
       functions have the same precision as the precision of the sampler parameter.
       What should the default precision of sampler types be?
       Option 1: lowp. This will be faster on some implementations. In general, OpenGL ES should default to
       fast operation rather than precise operation. It is usually easier to detect and correct a functional error
       than a performance issue.
       Option 2: lowp for textures that are expected to contain color values. highp for textures that are expected
       to contain other values e.g. depth.
       Option 2: No default precision. Although this requires that the precision be specified in every shader, it
       will force the developer to consider the requirements.
       RESOLUTION: The default precision of all sampler types present in GLSL ES 1.0 should also be lowp
       in GLSL ES 3.0. New sampler types in GLSL ES 3.0 should have no default precision.

12.6   Function and Variable Name Spaces
       Do variables and functions share the same name space? GLSL ES doesn't support function pointers so the
       grammar can always be used to distinguish cases. However this is a departure from C++.
       RESOLUTION: Functions and variables share the same name space.


       Should redeclarations of the same names be permitted within the same scope? This would be compatible
       with C. There are several cases e.g.:
           1.   Redeclaring a function. A function prototype is a declaration but not a definition. A function
                definition is both a declaration and a definition. Consequently a function prototype and a
                function definition (of the same function) within the same scope qualifies as redeclaration.
           2.   Declaring a name as a function and then redeclaring it as a structure.
           3.   Declaring a name as a variable and then redeclaring it as a structure.
       Disallowing multiple function declarations (including allowing a separate function prototype and function
       definition) would prevent static recursion by design. However it imposes constraints on the structure of
       shaders.
       GLSL ES 1.00 allows a single function definition plus a single optional function declaration.
       RESOLUTION: Multiple definitions are disallowed. Multiple function declarations (function
       prototypes) are allowed. This is in line with C++.




                                                      128
                                                                                                     12 Issues



12.7   Local Function Declarations and Function Hiding
       Should local functions hide all functions of the same same?
       This is considered useful if local function declarations are allowed. However, the only use for local
       function declarations in GLSL ES is to unhide functions that have been hidden by variable or structure
       declarations. This is not a compelling reason to include them.
       RESOLUTION: Disallow local function declarations.

12.8   Overloading main()
       Should it be possible for the user to overload the main() function?
       RESOLUTION: No. The main function cannot be overloaded.

12.9   Error Reporting
       In general which errors must be reported by the compiler?
       Some errors are easy to detect. All grammar errors and type matching errors will normally be detected as
       part of the normal compilation process. Other semantic errors will require specific code in the compiler.
       The bulk of the work in a compiler occurs after parsing so adding some error detection should not
       increase the total cost of compilation significantly. However, it is expected that development systems will
       have sophisticated error and warning reporting and it is not necessary to repeat this process for on-target
       compilers.
       RESOLUTION: All grammar, type mismatch and other specific semantic errors as listed in this
       specification must be reported. Reporting of other errors or warnings is optional.


       Should compilers report if maxima are exceeded, even if the implementation supports them? This could
       aid portability.
       RESOLUTION: No, high-end implementations may quite legitimately go beyond the specification in
       these areas and mandating the use of the extension mechanism would cause needless complexity.
       Development systems should issue portability warnings.


       Should static recursion be detected?
       RESOLUTION: Yes, the compiler will normally generate the necessary control flow graph so detection
       is easy.

12.10 Structure Declarations
       Should structures with the same name and same member variables be considered as the same type?
       RESOLUTION: No, follow the C++ rules. Variables only have the same type if they have been declared
       with the same type and not if they have been declared with different types that have the same name. This
       does not apply to linking (for uniforms and varyings) which has its own rules.




                                                     129
                                                                                                     12 Issues




      Should structure declarations be allowed in function parameters?
      RESOLUTION: No, following the previous resolution it would be impossible to call such a function
      because it would be impossible to declare a variable with the same structure type.

12.11 Embedded Structure Definitions
      Should embedded structure definitions be allowed?
      e.g.
             struct S
             {
                struct T
                {
                  int a;
                } t;
                int b:
             };

      In order to access the constructor, the structure name would have to be scoped at the same level as the
      outer level structure. This is inconsistent.

      Option 1: Disallow embedded structure definitions.
      Option 2: Allow embedded structure definitions but accept that the constructor is not accessible.
      Option 3: Scope embedded structure names at the same level as the outermost scope name.
      RESOLUTION: Remove embedded structure definitions.

12.12 Redefining Built-in Functions
      Should it be possible to redefine or overload built-in functions?
      There may be some applications where it is useful to redefine the built-in functions but the language does
      not include the required functionality for all cases. Built-in functions are likely to be efficiently mapped
      to the hardware. User-defined functions may not be as efficient but may be able to offer greater precision
      (e.g. for the trig functions). The application may then want access to both the original and new function.
      Some user-defined functions would benefit from access to the original function. Once the new function
      has been declared, the original function is hidden so both these use cases are impossible with the current
      specification.


      Option 1: Allow both redefinition and overloading of built-in functions.
      Option 2: Disallow redefinition of built-in functions. Allow them to be overloaded. This may be useful
      where it is required to extend the functionality of a built-in function. However it creates a subtle
      incompatibility with the desktop:




                                                    130
                                                                                                      12 Issues



         int sin(int x) {return x;}
         void main()
         {
           float a = sin(1.0); // legal in GLSL ES, not legal in desktop GLSL.
         }


      It is also a potential source of backwards-incompatibility if a future version of the language introduces
      new overloads.
      Option 3: Remove the ability to redefine or overload functions.
      RESOLUTION: Disallow both overloading and redefining built-in functions. There is no compelling use
      case.

12.13 Global Scope
      How should the scoping levels for user-defined and built-in names be defined?
      GLSL ES 1.00 and most versions of GLSL have a global scope for user-defined functions and variables
      and a distinct 'outer' scope where the built-in functions reside. This is different from C++. Since GLSL
      ES 3.00 does not allow the redefinition of built-in functions, a single global scope is sufficient.


      RESOLUTION: A single global scope will be used for user-defined and built-in names.

12.14 Constant Expressions
      Should user and built-in functions be allowed in constant expressions? e.g.
         const float a = sin(1.0);


      The compiler must be able to evaluate all possible constant expressions as they can potentially be used to
      size arrays and functions resolution is dependent on array size. Compile-time evaluation of built-in
      functions is expensive in terms of code size. The complexity of compile-time evaluation of user-defined
      functions is potentially unbounded.
      RESOLUTION: Allow built-in functions to be included in constant expressions. Redefinition of built-in
      functions is prohibited. User-defined functions are not allowed in constant expressions.

12.15 Varying Linkage
      In the vertex shader, a particular varying may be either 1) not declared, 2) declared but not written, 3)
      declared and written but not in all possible paths or 4) declared and written in all paths. Likewise a
      varying in a fragment shader may be either a) not declared, b) declared but not read, c) declared and read
      in some paths or d) declared and read in all paths. Which of these 16 combinations should generate an
      error?
      The compiler should not attempt to discover if a varying is read or written in all possible paths. This is
      considered too complex for OpenGL ES.




                                                     131
                                                                                                       12 Issues



      The same vertex shader may be paired with different fragment shaders. These fragment shaders may use a
      subset of the available input varyings. This behavior should be supported without causing errors.
      Therefore if the vertex shader writes to a varying that the fragment shader doesn't declare or declared but
      doesn't read then this is not an error.
      If the vertex shader declares but doesn't write to a varying and the fragment shader declares and reads it, is
      this an error?
      RESOLUTION: No.
      RESOLUTION: The only error case is when a varying is declared and read by the fragment shader but is
      not declared in the vertex shader.

12.16 gl_Position
      Is it an error if the vertex shader doesn't write to gl_Position? Whether a shader writes to gl_Position
      cannot always be determined e.g. if there is dependence on an attribute.
      Option 1: No it is not an error. The behavior is undefined in this case. Development systems should
      issue a warning in this case but the on-target compiler should not have to detect this.
      Option 2: It is an error if the vertex shader does not statically write to gl_Position
      Option 3: It is an error if there is any static path through the shader where gl_Position is not written.
      RESOLUTION: No error (option 1). The nature of the undefined behavior must be specified.

12.17 Preprocessor
      Is the preprocessor necessary?
      Arguments for removing or simplifying the preprocessor:
          â¢    The preprocessor is moderately complex to implement. In particular, function-like macros may
               have arbitrary complexity and require significant resources to compile.
          â¢    The C++ standard does not fully specify the preprocessor. In particular, the situations where
               preprocessor tokens are subject to macro expansion are not fully defined. Neither is the effect of
               macro definitions encountered during macro expansion.
          â¢    Over-use of the preprocessor is a common source of programming errors because there is limited
               compile-time checking.
      Arguments for retaining the preprocessor:
          â¢    The extension mechanism relies on the preprocessor so this would need to be replaced.
          â¢    The #define, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elsif and #endif constructs are commonly used for managing
               different versions and for include guards.
          â¢    There is no template mechanism in GLSL ES so macros are often used instead.
      GLSL ES 1.00 removed token pasting and other functionality.




                                                      132
                                                                                                       12 Issues



      RESOLUTION: Keep the basic preprocessor as defined in the GLSL ES 1.00 specification.

12.18 Character set
      GLSL ES 1.00 only allowed a subset of the ascii character set to be used in shaders. That included names
      and comments. The written languages of many countries include other characters or use a completely
      different character set. This makes it difficult or impossible to write comments in those languages.
      Where should the new characters be allowed? It would be possible to decide independently for comments,
      identifiers and macros. For macros, they could be allowed as part of macro definitions but prohibited in
      the final output of macro expansion.
      RESOLUTION: The new characters are only allowed inside comments.
      Which character set should be used to define the new characters.
      UTF-8 has the advantage that it is backwards-compatible with ASCII. All ASCII characters are valid
      UTF-8 single-byte characters and UTF-8 multi-byte characters all have the highest bit set to '1' in each
      byte. The disadvantage is that UTF-8 is variable length.
      RESOLUTION: UTF-8


      How should the extended character set be specified?
      Options include full UTF-8 or by explicitly listing the allowed characters.
      RESOLUTION: Full UTF-8


      Should the compiler check for the presence of invalid UTF-8 byte sequences?
      Since any multi-byte characters will only occur within comments and so not required further processing, it
      would be inexpensive to check for valid UTF-8 characters. Conversely, there appears to be no advantage
      to doing so. The issue of validity is only of concern to text editors.
      RESOLUTION: The compiler must not check for invalid UTF-8 characters. Bytes '0' and newline
      characters will be interpreted as such wherever they occur.


      How does the #version directive interact with the use of UTF-8 in comments?
      Following C++, the 'phases of translation' specification defines comment processing to be performed
      before macro directives are processed. However UTF-8 is legal in GLSL ES 3.00, identified by #version
      300 but not in GLSL ES 1.00, identified by #version 100 (or by absence of a #version directive).
      Option: The shader is processed in 2 passes. The first determines the shader version and the second
      performs compilation as before.
      Option: Replace the current version directive mechanism with a byte or character sequence that must
      always occur at the start of the shader. This is similar to other standards that have multiple versions e.g.
      http.




                                                     133
                                                                                                      12 Issues



      Option: Make UTF-8 characters an optional feature of GLSL ES 1.00


      RESOLUTION: Replace the version directive in GLSL ES 1.0 with a character sequence that must
      always occur at the start of the shader.

12.19 Line Continuation
      Should the line continuation character '\' be included in the specification?
      Line continuation was deliberately excluded from previous versions of GLSL and GLSL ES in order to
      discourage excessive use of the preprocessor. However, function-like macros are commonly used because
      there is no 'template' mechanism, which would allow functions to be parametrized by a type. Long macro
      definitions are therefore not uncommon and the line-continuation character may aid readability.
      Given that shader source is stored in a list of character strings, the newline character can be omitted and
      this has the same effect as a newline followed by a line-continuation.
      RESOLUTION: Include line-continuation.


      How does this interact with #version?
      RESOLUTION: Same issue as with UTF-8in general. Line-continuation to be made optional in GLSL ES
      1.00

12.20 Phases of Compilation
      Should the preprocessor run as the very first stage of compilation or after conversion to preprocessor
      tokens as with C/C++?
      The cases where the result is different are not common.
         #define e +1
         int n = 1e;

      According to the c++ standard, '1e' should be converted to a preprocessor token which then fails
      conversion to a number. If the preprocessor is run first, '1e' is expanded to '1+1' which is then parsed
      successfully.
      RESOLUTION: Follow c++ rules.

12.21 Maximum Number of Varyings
      How should gl_MaxVaryingFloats be defined? Originally this was specified as 32 floats but currently
      some desktop implementations fail to implement this correctly. Many implementations use 8 vec4
      registers and it is difficult to split varyings across multiple registers without losing performance.
      Option 1: Specify the maximum as 8 4-vectors. It is then up to the application to pack varyings. Other
      languages require the packing to be done by the application. Developers have not reported this as a
      problem.




                                                     134
                                                                                                12 Issues



Option 2: Specify the maximum according to a packing rule. The developer may use a non-optimal
packing so it is better to do this in the driver. Requiring the application to pack varyings is problematic
when shaders are automatically generated. It is easier for the driver to implement this.
RESOLUTION: The maximum will be specified according to a packing rule.


Should attributes and uniforms follow this rule?
RESOLUTION: Attributes should not follow this rule. They will be continued to be specified as vec4s.
RESOLUTION: Uniforms should not follow this rule for GLSL ES 3.00. Implementations are expected
to virtualize such resources.


Should the built-in special variables (gl_FragCoord, gl_FrontFacing, gl_PointCoord) be included in this
packing algorithm? Built-in special variables are implemented in a variety of ways. Some
implementations keep them in separate hardware, some do not.
RESOLUTION: Any built-in special variables that are statically used in the shader should be included in
the packing algorithm.


Should gl_FragCoord be included in the packing algorithm? The x and y components will always be
required for rasterization. The z and w components will often be required.
RESOLUTION: gl_FragCoord is included in the count of varyings.


How should mat2 varyings be packed?
Option 1: Pack them as 2x2.
Option 2: Pack them as 4 columns x 1 row. This is usually more efficient for an implementation.
Option 3: Allocate a 4 column x 2 row space. This is inefficient but allows flexibility in how
implementations map them to registers.
Option 4: As above but pack 2 mat2 varyings into each 4 column x 2 row block. Any unpaired mat2
takes a whole 4x2 block.
RESOLUTION: Option 3


Should mat3 take 3 whole rows?
This would again allow flexibility in implementation but it wastes space that could be used for floats or
float arrays.
RESOLUTION: No, mat3 should take a 3x3 block.


Should vec3 take a whole row?

                                                                                                     12 Issues



      RESOLUTION: No.


      Should gl_MaxVertexUniformsComponents be changed (from desktop GLSL) to reflect the packing
      rules?
      RESOLUTION: Rename gl_MaxVertexUniformComponents to gl_MaxVertexUniformVectors. Rename
      gl_MaxFragmentUniformComponents to gl_MaxFragmentUniformVectors.

12.22 Array Declarations
      Unsized array declarations.
      Desktop GLSL allows arrays to be declared without a size and these can then be accessed with constant
      integral expressions. The size never needs to be declared. This was to support gl_Texcoord e.g.
           varying vec4 gl_TexCoord[];
           ...
           gl_FragColor = texture (tex, gl_TexCoord[0].xy);

      This allows gl_TexCoord to be used without having to declare the number of texture units.
      gl_TexCoord is part of the fixed functionality so unsized arrays should be removed for GLSL ES
      RESOLUTION: Remove unsized array declarations.


      Which forms of array declarations should be permitted?
            float a[5];
            ...
            float b[] = a;       // b is explicitly size 5
      or
            float a[] = float[] (1.0, 2.0, 3.0);


      RESOLUTION: All above constructs are valid. However, any declaration that leaves the size undefined
      is disallowed as this would add complexity and there are no use-cases.

12.23 Invariance
      How should invariance between shaders be handled?
      Version 1.10 of desktop GLSL uses ftransform() to guarantee that gl_Position can be guaranteed to be
      calculated the same way in different vertex shaders. This relies on the fixed function that has been
      removed from ES. It is also very restrictive in that it only allows vertex transforms based on matrices. It
      does not apply to other values such as those used to generate texture coordinates.
      Option 1: Specify all operations to be invariant. No, this is too restrictive. Optimum use of resources
      becomes impossible for some implementations.




                                                    136
                                                                                                  12 Issues



Option 2: Add an invariance qualifier to functions that require invariance. No, this does not work as the
inputs to the functions and operations performed on the outputs may not be invariant.
Option 3: Add an invariance qualifier to all variables (including shader outputs).
RESOLUTION: Add an invariance qualifier to variables but permit its use only for outputs from the
vertex and fragment shaders. Add a global invariance option for use when complete invariance is
required.


Should the invariance qualifier be permitted on parameters to texture functions?
Many algorithms rely on two or more textures being exactly aligned, either within a single invocation of a
shader or using multi-pass techniques. This could be guaranteed by using the invariant qualifier on
variables that are used as parameters to the texture function.
Using the global invariance pragma also guarantees alignment of the textures. It is not clear whether
allowing finer control of invariance is useful in practice. Compilers may revert to global invariance and
there may be other specific cases that need to be considered.
RESOLUTION: Use of a variable as a parameter to a texture function does not imply that it may be
qualified as invariant.


Do invariance qualifiers for declarations in the vertex and fragment shaders need to match?
Option 1: Only allow invariance declarations on varyings in the vertex shader. The invariance of the
varying in the fragment shader should then be guaranteed automatically.
Option 2: Specify that they must match.
RESOLUTION: Invariance qualifiers for varying declarations must match.


Should this rule apply if the varying is declared but not used?
RESOLUTION: Yes, this rule applies for declarations, independent of usage.


How does this rule apply to the built-in special variables.
Option 1: It should be the same as for varyings. But gl_Position is used internally by the rasterizer as
well as for gl_FragCoord so there may be cases where rasterization is required to be invariant but
gl_FragCoord is not.
Option 2: gl_FragCoord and gl_PointCoord can be qualified as invariance if and only if gl_Position and
gl_PointSize are qualified invariant, respectively.


Can undefined values be made invariant?
If a type is implemented by a larger native type and due to lack of initialization, a variable of that type has
an illegal value, it is possible for variant behavior to occur.




                                                137
                                                                                                        12 Issues



      For example suppose a boolean is represented by a 32-bit integer with 'false' represented as 0 and 'true'
      represented as '1'. If the compiler uses both an 'equals 0' and an 'equals 1' test, the following may occur:
           bool b; // The implementation sets this to an illegal value e.g. 3

           if (b) // implementation tests 'b == 1' which is false
           {
             f();
           }
           else // implementation tests 'b == 0' which is also false
           {
             g();
           }

      Neither f() nor g() are executed which is unexpected behavior. Such cases could be made invariant but
      would for example require the compiler to initialize undefined values which is a performance cost.


      RESOLUTION: Undefined values cannot be made invariant. These shaders are malformed and therefore
      have undefined behavior.

12.24 Invariance Within a shader
      How should invariance within a shader be specified?
      Compilers may decide to recalculate a value rather than store it in a register (rematerialization). The new
      value may not be exactly the same as the original value.
      Option 1: Prohibit this behavior.
      Option 2: Use the invariance qualifier on variables to control this. This is consistent with the desktop.
      RESOLUTION: Values with in a shader are in variant be default. The invariance qualifier or pragma
      may be used to make them invariant.


      Should constant expressions be invariant? In the following example, it is not defined whether the literal
      expression should always evaluate to the same value.
                   precision mediump int;
                   precision mediump float;
                   const int size = int(ceil(4.0/3.0 â 0.333333));
                   int a[size];
                   for (int i=0; i<int(ceil(4.0/3.0 â 0.333333)); i++) {a [i] = i;}




                                                     138
                                                                                                        12 Issues



      Implementations must usually be able to evaluate constant expressions at compile time since they can be
      used to declare the size of arrays. Hardware may compute a less accurate value compared with maths
      libraries available in C. It would however be expected that functions such as sine and cosine return
      similar results whether or not they are part of a constant expression. This suggests that the
      implementation might want to evaluate these functions only on the hardware. However, there are no
      situations, even with global invariance, where compile time evaluation and runtime evaluation must match
      exactly.
      RESOLUTION: Yes, constant expressions must be invariant.

12.25 While-loop Declarations
      What is the purpose of allowing variable declarations in a while statement?
         while (bool b = f()) {...}

      Boolean b will always be true until the point where it is destroyed. It is useful in C++ since integers are
      implicitly converted to booleans.
      RESOLUTION: Keep this behavior. Will be required if implicit type conversion is added to a future
      version.


      A similar issue exists in for-loops. The grammar allows constructs such as
         for(;bool x = a < b;) ;


12.26 Cross Linking Between Shaders
      Should it be permissible for a fragment shader to call a function defined in a vertex shader or vice versa?
      RESOLUTION: No, there is no need for this behavior.

12.27 Visibility of Declarations
      At what point should a declaration take effect?
         int x=1;
         {
           int x=2, y=x; // case A
           int z=z;      // case B
         }
      Option 1: The name should be visible immediately after the identifier. Both cases above are legal. In
      case A, y is initialized to the value 2. This is consistent with c++. For case B, the use case is to initialize
      a variable to point to itself e.g. void* p = &p; This is not relevant to GLSL ES.
      Option 2: The name should be visible after the initializer (if present), otherwise immediately after the
      identifier. In case A, y is initialized to 2. Case B is an error (assuming no prior declaration of z).
      Option 3: The name should be visible after the declaration. In case A, y is initialized to 1. Case B is an
      error if z is has no prior declaration.




                                                      139
                                                                                                  12 Issues



     RESOLUTION: Option 2. Declarations are visible after the initializer if present, otherwise after the
     identifier.

12.28 Language Version
     What version number should the language have? This version of the language is based on version 3.30 of
     the desktop GLSL. However it includes a number of features that are in version 4.20 but not 3.30. The
     previous version of GLSL ES was version 1.00 so this version could be called version 2.00.
     RESOLUTION: Follow the desktop GLSL convention so that the language version matches the API
     version. Hence this version will be called 3.00

12.29 Samplers
     Should samplers be allowed as l-values? The specification already allows an equivalent behavior:
     Current specification:
        uniform sampler2D sampler[8];
        int index = f(...);
        vec4 tex = texture(sampler[index], xy); // allowed

     Using assignment of sampler types:
        uniform sampler2D s;
        s = g(...);
        vec4 tex = texture(s, xy); //             not allowed

     RESOLUTION: Dynamic indexing of sampler arrays is now prohibited by the specification. Restrict
     indexing of sampler arrays to constant integral expressions.

12.30 Dynamic Indexing
     For GLSL ES 1.00, support of dynamic indexing of arrays, vectors and matrices was not mandated
     because it was not directly supported by some implementations. Software solutions (via program
     transforms) exist for a subset of cases but lead to poor performance. Should support for dynamic indexing
     be mandated for GLSL ES 3.00?
     RESOLUTION: Mandate support for dynamic indexing of arrays except for sampler arrays, fragment
     output arrays and uniform block arrays.


     Should support for dynamic indexing of vectors and matrices be mandated in GLSL ES 3.00?
     RESOLUTION: Yes.


     Indexing of arrays of samplers by constant-index-expressions is supported in GLSL ES 1.00. A constant-
     index-expression is an expression formed from constant-expressions and certain loop indices, defined for
     a subset of loop constructs. Should this functionality be included in GLSL ES 3.00?




                                                  140
                                                                                                    12 Issues



      RESOLUTION: No. Arrays of samplers may only be indexed by constant-integral-expressions.

12.31 Maximum Number of Texture Units
      The minimum number of texture units that must be supported in the fragment shader is currently 2 as
      defined by gl_MaxTextureImageUnits = 8. Is this too low for GLSL ES 3.0?
      Option 1: Yes, the number of texturing units is the limiting factor for fragment shaders. The number of
      texture units was increased from 1 to 2 going from OpenGL ES 1.0 to OpenGL ES 1.1 and increased to 8
      for OpenGL ES 2.0
      RESOLUTION: Increase to 16

12.32 On-target Error Reporting
      Should compilers be required to report any errors at compile time or can errors be deferred until link
      time?
      RESOLUTION: If a program cannot be compiled, on-target compilers are only required to report that an
      error has occurred. This error may be reported at compile time or link time or both. Development
      systems must generate grammar errors at compile time.

12.33 Rounding of Integer Division
      Should the rounding mode be specified for integer division?
      The rounding mode for division is related to the definition of the remainder operator. The important
      relation in most languages (but not relevant in this version of GLSL ES) is:
               (a / b) * b + a % b = a    (a and b are integers)
      Usually the remainder operator is defined to have the same sign as the dividend which implies that divide
      must round towards zero. (Note that the modulo function is not the same as the remainder function.
      Modulo is defined to have the same sign as the divisor).
      The remainder operator was not part of GLSL ES 1.00, so it was not necessary to specify the rounding
      mode. In GLSL ES 3.00, the remainder operator is included but the results are undefined if either or both
      operands are negative.
      RESOLUTION: The rounding mode is undefined for this version of the specification.

12.34 Undefined Return Values
      If a function is declared with a non-void return type, any return statements within the definition must
      specify a return expression with a type matching the return type. However if the function returns without
      executing a return statement the behavior is undefined. Should the compiler attempt to check for these
      cases and report them as an error?




                                                    141
                                                                                                        12 Issues



      Example:
         int f()
         {
           // no return statement
         }

         ...

         int a = f();

      Option 1: An undefined value is returned to the caller. No error is generated. This is what most c++
      compilers do in practice (although the c++ standard actually specifies 'undefined behavior').
      Option 2: There must be a return statement at the end of all function definitions that return a value.
      No, this requires statements to be added that may be impossible to execute.
      Option 3: A return statement at the end of a function definition is required only if it is possible for
      execution to reaches the end of the function:
      E.g.
         int f(bool b)
         {
           if (b)
             return 1;
           else
             return 0;
           // No error. The execution can never reach the end of the function so
           // the implicit return statement is never executed.
         }

      This becomes impossible to determine in the presence of loops.
      Option 4: All finite static paths through a function definition must end with a return statement. A static
      path is a path that could potentially be taken if each branch in the code could be controlled independently.
      RESOLUTION: Option 1: The function returns an undefined value.

12.35 Precisions of Operations
      Should the precision of operations such as add and multiply be defined?
      These are not defined by the C++ standard but it is generally assumed that C++ implementations will use
      IEEE 754 arithmetic. This is not true for GPUs which generally support only a subset of IEEE 754. In
      addition, many operations such as the transcendental functions are considered too expensive to implement
      with more than 10 significant bits of precision. Division is commonly implemented by reciprocal and
      multiplication.
      RESOLUTION: Include a table of precisions for operations.




                                                      142
                                                                                                    12 Issues



12.36 Compiler Transforms
      What compiler transforms should be allowed?
      C++ prohibits compiler transforms of expressions that alter the final result. (Note that C++ allows higher
      precisions than specified to be used but this is a different issue.) GPUs commonly make use of such
      transforms, for example when mapping sequential code to vector-based architectures.
      RESOLUTION: A specified set of transforms (in addition to those permitted by C++) are allowed.

12.37 Expansion of Function-like Macros in the Preprocessor
      When expanding macros, each macro can only be applied once to the original token or any token
      generated from that token. To implement this, the expansion of function-like macros requires a list of
      applied macros for each token to be maintained. This is a large overhead.
      RESOLUTION: Follow the C++ specification.
      What should the behavior be if a directive is encountered during expansion of function-like macros?
      This is currently specified as undefined in C++ although several compilers implement the expected
      behavior.
      RESOLUTION: Leave as undefined behavior.

12.38 Should Extension Macros be Globally Defined?
      For each extension there is an associated macro that the shader can use to determine if an extension is
      available on a given implementation. Should this macro be defined globally or should it be defined when
      the extension is (successfully) enabled?
      Both alternatives are usable since attempting to enable an unimplemented extension only results in a
      warning.
      Option 1: Globally defined
         #ifdef GL_OES_<extension-name>
           #extension GL_OES_<extension-name> : enable
           ...
         #endif

      Option 2: Defined as part of #extension
         #extension GL_OES_<extension-name> : enable // warning if not available
         #ifdef GL_OES_<extension-name>
           ...
         #endif

      RESOLUTION: The macros are defined globally. There should be a warning-free path for all legal cases.

                                                                                                      12 Issues



12.39 Minimum Requirements
      GLSL ES 1.00 specified a set of minimum requirements that effectively made parts of the specification
      optional. The purpose was to enable low cost implementations while allowing higher performance
      devices to expose features without recourse to extensions. That flexibility came at the cost of portability.
      Should the minimum requirements section be included as part of GLSL ES 3.00?
      RESOLUTION: No, except for the section on counting of varyings.

12.40 Packing Functions
      These functions are used to pack and unpack a 32-bit bit-vector into various types.
      Should the conversions be based on the precision (lowp, mediump, highp)? e.g.
         highp uint        packFloat2x16(mediump vec2 v);


      RESOLUTION: No. Since mediump can be implemented using more than 16 bits, packing and then
      unpacking a mediump value might result in a different value on some platforms but not on others.


      Should conversion to and from 8-bit types be supported?
      RESOLUTION: No. It is not clear which low precision types to support. e.g. lowp is nominally 10 bit.


      Which variant of snorm should be used?
      Option 1: The range is [-32768, +32767]. Zero is not representable. Uses all the available values.
      Sometimes known as the 'attribute snorm format'.
      Option 2: The range is [-32767, +32767]. Zero is representable. Does not use all the available values.
      Sometimes known as the 'texture snorm format'.
      RESOLUTION: Option 2. It is important that zero is representable. Option 1 is simpler to implement but
      this is not considered significant for current hardware. The API specification will be amended to use this
      format for all snorm to float and float to snorm conversions.

12.41 Boolean logical vector operations
      The logical binary operators and (&&), or ( | | ), and exclusive or (^^) operate only on two boolean
      expressions and result in a boolean expression. Should they be extended to operate on boolean vectors?
      The 2nd operand is conditionally evaluated for these operators.
           bvec4 f();
           bvec4 g();

           f() && g(); // g() gets 'run' for some components but not others.
                       // This isn't well defined.

      RESOLUTION: No, these should not be part of the language.




                                                     144
                                                                                                     12 Issues



12.42 Range Checking of literals
      Should an error be generated if a literal integer is outside the range of a 32-bit integer?
      This can be easily checked by the compiler. However, there is a complication because the literal does not
      include the minus sign for negative constants. Signed integers can be distinguished from unsigned
      integers by the 'u' suffix but the value 0x8000000 is only valid if preceded by a unary minus.
      Option: Check only that the numeric part of a literal integer (signed or unsigned) is representable by 32
      bits.
      Option: Include any preceding unary minus and check that the literal is within the range of a signed or
      unsigned integer as appropriate.
      Option: Extend the checking to any constant integral expression.
      RESOLUTION: It is an error to have a literal unsigned integer outside the range of a 32-bit integer.


      Should this apply to floating-point numbers?
      The GLSL spec allows an arbitrary number of digits before the decimal point. It therefore possible for a
      float literal to have an arbitrarily large number of characters but still be representable e.g.
         1<1 million zeros>.0e-1000000

           1. Parsing constraints. Should the number of characters in each field be limited in some way?
                    1. Should the mantissa be limited to e.g. 16 characters?
                    2. Should the unsigned part of the mantissa be required to fit into a 32 bit integer?
           2. Range checks.
                    1. If the value is larger than 3.40282347e38, should it be required to return INF? Or return
                       an error?
      RESOLUTION: No limit on the number of characters in the mantissa or exponent in a float literal.
      RESOLUTION: Values larger than representable in a float 32 must return INF (+ or - as appropriate).
      Values with a magnitude too small to be representable in a float 32 must return zero.



12.43 Sequence operator and constant expressions
      Should the following construct be allowed?
         float a[2,3];

      The expression within the brackets uses the sequence operator (',') and returns the integer 3 so the
      construct is declaring a single-dimensional array of size 3. In some languages, the construct declares a
      two-dimensional array. It would be preferable to make this construct illegal to avoid confusion.




                                                      145
                                                                                                       12 Issues



      One possibility is to change the definition of the sequence operator so that it does not return a constant-
      expression and hence cannot be used to declare an array size.
      RESOLUTION: The result of a sequence operator is not a constant-expression.

12.44 Version Directive
      The version directive in GLSL ES 1.00 has been found to be unsuitable in cases where certain features of
      the language specification are changed. The existing mechanism relies on a preprocessor directive but,
      following the order of operations specified by the 'phases of translation' section in the C++ specification,
      it is difficult or perhaps impossible to change features of the language that are processed before such
      directives are invoked. Such features include the introduction of the line-continuation character ('\') and
      the extension of the character set.
      There are several options for an improved version mechanism. All specify the version in the first line of
      the shader and require that the version directive is followed by a newline.
      Option 1: Add a byte sequence to the start of the shader. This would allow any change to be made to the
      language, including changing the character set. This mechanism is often used in file formats for images.
      Option 2: Add a character string sequence to the start of the shader. Define it to appear to be a
      preprocessor directive e.g.
         #version 300 es

      Option 3: As option 2 but allow some flexibility in the format so that extra white-space would still be
      allowed.
      Option 4: As option 2 but use a distinctive non-preprocessor format e.g.
         version-300-es

      Option 5: As option 4 but include the characters 'glsl' to aid identification e.g.
         glsl-version-300-es

      RESOLUTION: Option 3. The version directive is a string, present as the only non-white-space in the first
      line of the shader. It is very unlikely that the character set will be changed in an incompatible way from
      UTF-8 in the future. Option 3 is the closest in appearance to the current mechanism.

12.45 Use of Unsigned Integers
      Should functions that can only return a positive value e.g. textureSize() and the length() method, return
      signed or unsigned values?
      Option 1: Unsigned integer. This allows for some degree of compile-time checking. For example it
      would be impossible to accidentally access an array element with a negative index in a typical
      initialization loop such as:




                                                     146
                                                                                                12 Issues



   float a[5];
   for (unit i=0u; i<a.length (); i++)
     a[i] = 0.0;

Option 2: Signed integer. This allows greater flexibility in calculating array indices without the need for
type conversions e.g.
   float a[SIZE];
   ...
   int index = a.length() - 3; // Library code. SIZE may not be known when
                               // this code is written
   if (index >= 0)             // would not work with an unsigned integer
     f(a[index]);


RESOLUTION: Option 2. The principle is that integers that represent values and hence may form part of
arithmetic expressions should always be signed, even if it is known that they will always be positive.
Values that represent bit vectors should always be unsigned.
The extra checking made available by the use of unsigned integers for values known to be positive is
minimal. It would be preferable to include a range mechanism in a future version of the language.
