1 Introduction

        This document specifies only version 1.30 of the OpenGL Shading Language. It requires __VERSION__
        to substitute 130, and requires #version to accept only 130. If #version is declared with 110 or 120, the
        language accepted is a previous version of the shading language, which will be supported depending on
        the version and type of context in the OpenGL API. See the OpenGL Graphics System Specification,
        Version 3.0, for details on what language versions are supported.

â¢       Removed inout as a way of declaring interface variables, to avoid the problem of things like
        interpolation qualifiers not knowing if they are modifying the copy in or the copy out. Also removes
        the problem of implicit pass through for a variable declared inout but never used.
â¢       True native integer support
        â¢     signed and unsigned integer semantics
        â¢     bitwise operators and shifts

â¢       Deprecated gl_ClipVertex
â¢       Added gl_VertexID
â¢       It's an error to use #if etc. on an undefined name
Changes from revision 2 of version 1.30 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    â¢       Large rework of section 8.7 Texture Lookup Functions. Dropped dimensionality/shadow from the
            names, organized by type instead of dimensionality, added in Lod control.
    â¢       Use gl_Position for clipping if gl_ClipVertex is not statically written.
    â¢       Remove language about the fixed pipeline in the description of ftransform().
Changes from revision 10 of version 1.20 of the OpenGL Shading Language




                                                      5
                                                                                                1 Introduction



       â¢    in, out, and inout are used at global scope as the preferred way of declaring attributes, varyings,
            and fragment shader outputs. This eases the usage of centroid, flat, smooth, invariant, etc. by
            reducing the number of keywords needed to declare a variable, removes the misnomer that flat
            variables vary, provides for a default interpolation, and scales to additional future programmable
            pipe stages.
       â¢    Common blocks are added and can be backed by buffers in the API.
       â¢    âgl_â prefixed uniforms and attributes and several of the varyings no longer reflect built-in state,
            but are predeclared by the language as a convenience to the user.
       â¢    The ability to index into an array of samplers with a variable index is removed.
       â¢    Token pasting (##) is added to the preprocessor.
       â¢    Add row_major to support row-major matrices to allow packing of a 3-row 4-column matrix into 3
            uniforms or 3 attributes.
       â¢    Support #include via named source strings.
       â¢    Accept the precision qualifiers from OpenGL ES with no expectation that anything is done with
            them.
       â¢    switch statements are added for integer scalars only
       â¢    mix() is expanded to operate on a Boolean 3rd argument that does not interpolate but selects.

1.3   Overview
      This document describes The OpenGL Shading Language, version 1.30.
      Independent compilation units written in this language are called shaders. A program is a complete set of
      shaders that are compiled and linked together. The aim of this document is to thoroughly specify the
      programming language. The OpenGL Graphics System Specification will specify the OpenGL entry
      points used to manipulate and communicate with programs and shaders.

1.4   Error Handling
      Compilers, in general, accept programs that are ill-formed, due to the impossibility of detecting all ill-
      formed programs. Portability is only ensured for well-formed programs, which this specification
      describes. Compilers are encouraged to detect ill-formed programs and issue diagnostic messages, but are
      not required to do so for all cases. Compilers are required to return messages regarding lexically,
      grammatically, or semantically incorrect shaders.

1.5   Typographical Conventions
      Italic, bold, and font choices have been used in this specification primarily to improve readability. Code
      fragments use a fixed width font. Identifiers embedded in text are italicized. Keywords embedded in text
      are bold. Operators are called by their name, followed by their symbol in bold in parentheses. The
      clarifying grammar fragments in the text use bold for literals and italics for non-terminals. The official
      grammar in Section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ uses all capitals for terminals and lower case for
      non-terminals.

1.6   Deprecation
      This version of the OpenGL Shading Language deprecates some features. These are clearly called out in
      this specification as âdeprecatedâ. They are still present in this version of the language, but are targeted
      for potential removal in a future version of the shading language. The OpenGL API has a forward
      compatibility mode that will disallow use of deprecated features. If compiling in a mode where use of
      deprecated features is disallowed, their use causes compile time errors. See the OpenGL Graphics System
      Specification for details on what causes deprecated language features to be accepted or to return an error.

2 Overview of OpenGL Shading

      The OpenGL Shading Language is actually two closely related languages. These languages are used to
      create shaders for the programmable processors contained in the OpenGL processing pipeline.
      Unless otherwise noted in this paper, a language feature applies to all languages, and common usage will
      refer to these languages as a single language. The specific languages will be referred to by the name of
      the processor they target: vertex or fragment.
      Most OpenGL state is not tracked or made available to shaders. Typically, user-defined variables will be
      used for communicating between different stages of the OpenGL pipeline. However, a small amount of
      state is still tracked and automatically made available to shaders, and there are a few built-in variables for
      interfaces between different stages of the OpenGL pipeline.

2.1   Vertex Processor
      The vertex processor is a programmable unit that operates on incoming vertices and their associated data.
      Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called vertex
      shaders. When a complete set of vertex shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a vertex shader
      executable that runs on the vertex processor.
      The vertex processor operates on one vertex at a time. It does not replace graphics operations that require
      knowledge of several vertices at a time. The vertex shaders running on the vertex processor must
      compute the homogeneous position of the incoming vertex.

2.2   Fragment Processor
      The fragment processor is a programmable unit that operates on fragment values and their associated
      data. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called
      fragment shaders. When a complete set of fragment shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a
      fragment shader executable that runs on the fragment processor.
      A fragment shader cannot change a fragment's (x, y) position. Access to neighboring fragments is not
      allowed. The values computed by the fragment shader are ultimately used to update frame-buffer memory
      or texture memory, depending on the current OpenGL state and the OpenGL command that caused the
      fragments to be generated.

3 Basics

3.1   Character Set
      The source character set used for the OpenGL shading languages is a subset of ASCII. It includes the
      following characters:
            The letters a-z, A-Z, and the underscore ( _ ).
            The numbers 0-9.
            The symbols period (.), plus (+), dash (-), slash (/), asterisk (*), percent (%), angled brackets (< and
            >), square brackets ( [ and ] ), parentheses ( ( and ) ), braces ( { and } ), caret (^), vertical bar ( | ),
            ampersand (&), tilde (~), equals (=), exclamation point (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), comma (,), and
            question mark (?).
            The number sign (#) for preprocessor use.
            White space: the space character, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, carriage-return, and line-
            feed.
      Lines are relevant for compiler diagnostic messages and the preprocessor. They are terminated by
      carriage-return or line-feed. If both are used together, it will count as only a single line termination. For
      the remainder of this document, any of these combinations is simply referred to as a new-line. There is no
      line continuation character.
      In general, the languageâs use of this character set is case sensitive.
      There are no character or string data types, so no quoting characters are included.
      There is no end-of-file character.

3.2   Source Strings
      The source for a single shader is an array of strings of characters from the character set. A single shader
      is made from the concatenation of these strings. Each string can contain multiple lines, separated by new-
      lines. No new-lines need be present in a string; a single line can be formed from multiple strings. No
      new-lines or other characters are inserted by the implementation when it concatenates the strings to form a
      single shader. Multiple shaders can be linked together to form a single program.
      Diagnostic messages returned from compiling a shader must identify both the line number within a string
      and which source string the message applies to. Source strings are counted sequentially with the first
      string being string 0. Line numbers are one more than the number of new-lines that have been processed.

                                                                                                      3 Basics



3.3   Preprocessor
      There is a preprocessor that processes the source strings as part of the compilation process.
      The complete list of preprocessor directives is as follows.
         #
         #define
         #undef

         #if
         #ifdef
         #ifndef
         #else
         #elif
         #endif

         #error
         #pragma

         #extension
         #version

         #line

      The following operators are also available
         defined
         ##

      Each number sign (#) can be preceded in its line only by spaces or horizontal tabs. It may also be
      followed by spaces and horizontal tabs, preceding the directive. Each directive is terminated by a new-
      line. Preprocessing does not change the number or relative location of new-lines in a source string.
      The number sign (#) on a line by itself is ignored. Any directive not listed above will cause a diagnostic
      message and make the implementation treat the shader as ill-formed.
      #define and #undef functionality are defined as is standard for C++ preprocessors for macro definitions
      both with and without macro parameters.
      The following predefined macros are available
         __LINE__
         __FILE__
         __VERSION__

      __LINE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that is one more than the number of preceding new-
      lines in the current source string.
      __FILE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that says which source string number is currently
      being processed.




                                                     10
                                                                                                  3 Basics



__VERSION__ will substitute a decimal integer reflecting the version number of the OpenGL shading
language. The version of the shading language described in this document will have __VERSION__
substitute the decimal integer 130.
All macro names containing two consecutive underscores ( __ ) are reserved for future use as predefined
macro names. All macro names prefixed with âGL_â (âGLâ followed by a single underscore) are also
reserved.
#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif are defined to operate as is standard for C++ preprocessors.
Expressions following #if and #elif are further restricted to expressions operating on literal integer
constants, plus identifiers consumed by the defined operator. It is an error to use #if or #elif on
expressions containing undefined macro names, other than as arguments to the defined operator.
Character constants are not supported. The operators available are as follows.


      Precedence Operator class                               Operators               Associativity

                                                                 + - ~ !
        3              multiplicative                            * / %                Left to Right
        4              additive                                  + -                  Left to Right

        7              equality                                  == !=                Left to Right
        8              bit-wise and                              &                    Left to Right
        9              bit-wise exclusive or                     ^                    Left to Right
      10               bit-wise inclusive or                     |                    Left to Right
      11               logical and                               &&                   Left to Right
      12 (lowest)      logical inclusive or                      ||                   Left to Right


The defined operator can be used in either of the following ways:
   defined identifier
   defined ( identifier )

Two tokens in a macro can be concatenated into one token using the token pasting (##) operator, as is
standard for C++ preprocessors. The result must be a valid single token, which will then be subject to
macro expansion. That is, macro expansion happens after token pasting and does not happen before token
pasting. There are no other number sign based operators (e.g. no # or #@), nor is there a sizeof operator.
The semantics of applying operators to integer literals in the preprocessor match those standard in the
C++ preprocessor, not those in the OpenGL Shading Language.




                                                11
                                                                                                3 Basics



Preprocessor expressions will be evaluated according to the behavior of the host processor, not the
processor targeted by the shader.
#error will cause the implementation to put a diagnostic message into the shader objectâs information log
(see the OpenGL Graphics System Specification for how to access a shader objectâs information log).
The message will be the tokens following the #error directive, up to the first new-line. The
implementation must then consider the shader to be ill-formed.
#pragma allows implementation dependent compiler control. Tokens following #pragma are not subject
to preprocessor macro expansion. If an implementation does not recognize the tokens following
#pragma, then it will ignore that pragma. The following pragmas are defined as part of the language.
   #pragma STDGL

The STDGL pragma is used to reserve pragmas for use by future revisions of this language. No
implementation may use a pragma whose first token is STDGL.
   #pragma optimize(on)
   #pragma optimize(off)

can be used to turn off optimizations as an aid in developing and debugging shaders. It can only be used
outside function definitions. By default, optimization is turned on for all shaders. The debug pragma
   #pragma debug(on)
   #pragma debug(off)

can be used to enable compiling and annotating a shader with debug information, so that it can be used
with a debugger. It can only be used outside function definitions. By default, debug is turned off.
Shaders should declare the version of the language they are written to. The language version a shader is
written to is specified by
   #version number

where number must be a version of the language, following the same convention as __VERSION__ above.
The directive â#version 130â is required in any shader that uses version 1.30 of the language. Any
number representing a version of the language a compiler does not support will cause an error to be
generated. Version 1.10 of the language does not require shaders to include this directive, and shaders that
do not include a #version directive will be treated as targeting version 1.10. Different shaders
(compilation units) that are linked together in the same program must be the same version.
The #version directive must occur in a shader before anything else, except for comments and white space.




                                               12
                                                                                                  3 Basics



By default, compilers of this language must issue compile time syntactic, grammatical, and semantic
errors for shaders that do not conform to this specification. Any extended behavior must first be enabled.
Directives to control the behavior of the compiler with respect to extensions are declared with the
#extension directive
   #extension extension_name : behavior
   #extension all : behavior

where extension_name is the name of an extension. Extension names are not documented in this
specification. The token all means the behavior applies to all extensions supported by the compiler. The
behavior can be one of the following

 behavior                  Effect
         require           Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Give an error on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not
                           supported, or if all is specified.


         enable            Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.
                           Give an error on the #extension if all is specified.


          warn             Behave as specified by the extension extension_name, except issue warnings
                           on any detectable use of that extension, unless such use is supported by other
                           enabled or required extensions.
                           If all is specified, then warn on all detectable uses of any extension used.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.


         disable           Behave (including issuing errors and warnings) as if the extension
                           extension_name is not part of the language definition.
                           If all is specified, then behavior must revert back to that of the non-extended
                           core version of the language being compiled to.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.



The extension directive is a simple, low-level mechanism to set the behavior for each extension. It does
not define policies such as which combinations are appropriate, those must be defined elsewhere. Order
of directives matters in setting the behavior for each extension: Directives that occur later override those
seen earlier. The all variant sets the behavior for all extensions, overriding all previously issued
extension directives, but only for the behaviors warn and disable.




                                               13
                                                                                                       3 Basics



      The initial state of the compiler is as if the directive
         #extension all : disable

      was issued, telling the compiler that all error and warning reporting must be done according to this
      specification, ignoring any extensions.
      Each extension can define its allowed granularity of scope. If nothing is said, the granularity is a shader
      (that is, a single compilation unit), and the extension directives must occur before any non-preprocessor
      tokens. If necessary, the linker can enforce granularities larger than a single compilation unit, in which
      case each involved shader will have to contain the necessary extension directive.
      Macro expansion is not done on lines containing #extension and #version directives.
      #line must have, after macro substitution, one of the following forms:
         #line line
         #line line source-string-number

      where line and source-string-number are constant integer expressions. After processing this directive
      (including its new-line), the implementation will behave as if it is compiling at line number line+1 and
      source string number source-string-number. Subsequent source strings will be numbered sequentially,
      until another #line directive overrides that numbering.

3.4   Comments
      Comments are delimited by /* and */, or by // and a new-line. The begin comment delimiters (/* or //) are
      not recognized as comment delimiters inside of a comment, hence comments cannot be nested. If a
      comment resides entirely within a single line, it is treated syntactically as a single space. New-lines are
      not eliminated by comments.

3.5   Tokens
      The language is a sequence of tokens. A token can be

           token:
                keyword
                identifier
                integer-constant
                floating-constant
                operator
                ; { }

             row_major
      In addition, all identifiers containing two consecutive underscores (__) are reserved as possible future
      keywords.

3.7   Identifiers
      Identifiers are used for variable names, function names, structure names, and field selectors (field
      selectors select components of vectors and matrices similar to structure fields, as discussed in Section 5.5
      âVector Componentsâ and Section 5.6 âMatrix Componentsâ ). Identifiers have the form

           identifier
                nondigit
                identifier nondigit
                identifier digit
           nondigit: one of
               _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
               ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
           digit: one of

                                                                                                         3 Basics



                0123456789


      Identifiers starting with âgl_â are reserved for use by OpenGL, and may not be declared in a shader as
      either a variable or a function. However, as noted in the specification, there are some cases where
      previously declared variables can be redeclared to change or add some property, and predeclared "gl_"
      names are allowed to be redeclared in a shader only for these specific purposes. More generally, it is an
      error to redeclare a variable, including those starting âgl_â.

3.8   Static Use
      Some language rules described below depend on whether something is statically written or used.
      A shader contains a static use of (or static assignment to) a variable x if, after preprocessing, the shader
      contains a statement that would read (or write) x, whether or not run-time flow of control will cause that
      statement to be executed.

4 Variables and Types

      All variables and functions must be declared before being used. Variable and function names are
      identifiers.
      There are no default types. All variable and function declarations must have a declared type, and
      optionally qualifiers. A variable is declared by specifying its type followed by one or more names
      separated by commas. In many cases, a variable can be initialized as part of its declaration by using the
      assignment operator (=). The grammar near the end of this document provides a full reference for the
      syntax of declaring variables.
      User-defined types may be defined using struct to aggregate a list of existing types into a single name.
      The OpenGL Shading Language is type safe. There are no implicit conversions between types, with the
      exception that an integer value may appear where a floating-point type is expected, and be converted to a
      floating-point value. Exactly how and when this can occur is described in Section 4.1.10 âImplicit
      Conversionsâ and as referenced by other sections in this specification.

4.1   Basic Types
      The OpenGL Shading Language supports the following basic data types, grouped as follows.

                                                                                     4 Variables and Types

        Unsigned Integer Sampler Types (opaque)

             Type                         Meaning
             usampler1D                   a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 1D texture
             usampler2D                   a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 2D texture
             usampler3D                   a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 3D texture
             usamplerCube                 a handle for accessing an unsigned integer cube mapped texture
             usampler1DArray              a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 1D array texture
             usampler2DArray              a handle for accessing an unsigned integer 2D array texture

        In addition, a shader can aggregate these using arrays and structures to build more complex types.
        There are no pointer types.

4.1.1   Void
        Functions that do not return a value must be declared as void. There is no default function return type.
        The keyword void cannot be used in any other declarations (except for empty formal or actual parameter
        lists).

4.1.2   Booleans
        To make conditional execution of code easier to express, the type bool is supported. There is no
        expectation that hardware directly supports variables of this type. It is a genuine Boolean type, holding
        only one of two values meaning either true or false. Two keywords true and false can be used as literal
        Boolean constants. Booleans are declared and optionally initialized as in the follow example:
           bool success;      // declare âsuccessâ to be a Boolean
           bool done = false; // declare and initialize âdoneâ

        The right side of the assignment operator ( = ) must be an expression whose type is bool.
        Expressions used for conditional jumps (if, for, ?:, while, do-while) must evaluate to the type bool.




                                                       20
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.3   Integers
        Signed and unsigned integer variables are fully supported. In this document, the term integer is meant to
        generally include both signed and unsigned integers. Unsigned integers have exactly 32 bits of precision.
        Signed integers use 32 bits, including a sign bit, in two's complement form. Operations resulting in
        overflow or underflow will not cause any exception, nor will they saturate, rather they will âwrapâ to yield
        the low-order 32 bits of the result.
        Integers are declared and optionally initialized with integer expressions, as in the following example:
           int i, j = 42;           // default integer literal type is int
           uint k = 3u;             // âuâ establishes the type as uint

        Literal integer constants can be expressed in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16)
        as follows.

             integer-constant :
                  decimal-constant integer-suffixopt
                  octal-constant integer-suffixopt
                  hexadecimal-constant integer-suffixopt
             integer-suffix: one of
                  u U
             decimal-constant :
                 nonzero-digit
                 decimal-constant digit
             octal-constant :
                  0
                  octal-constant octal-digit
             hexadecimal-constant :
                 0x hexadecimal-digit
                 0X hexadecimal-digit
                 hexadecimal-constant hexadecimal-digit
             digit :
                   0
                   nonzero-digit
             nonzero-digit : one of
                 123456789
             octal-digit : one of
                  01234567
             hexadecimal-digit : one of
                 0123456789
                 abcdef

                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



                  ABCDEF


        No white space is allowed between the digits of an integer constant, including after the leading 0 or after
        the leading 0x or 0X of a constant, or before the suffix u or U. When the suffix u or U is present, the
        literal has type uint, otherwise the type is int. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted as an
        arithmetic unary negation, not as part of the constant.
        It is an error to provide a literal integer whose magnitude is too large to store in a variable of matching
        signed or unsigned type.

4.1.4   Floats
        Floats are available for use in a variety of scalar calculations. Floating-point variables are defined as in the
        following example:
           float a, b = 1.5;

        As an input value to one of the processing units, a floating-point variable is expected to match the IEEE
        single precision floating-point definition for precision and dynamic range. It is not required that the
        precision of internal processing match the IEEE floating-point specification for floating-point operations,
        but the guidelines for precision established by the OpenGL 1.4 specification must be met. Similarly,
        treatment of conditions such as divide by 0 may lead to an unspecified result, but in no case should such a
        condition lead to the interruption or termination of processing.
        Floating-point constants are defined as follows.

             floating-constant :
                   fractional-constant exponent-partopt floating-suffixopt
                  digit-sequence exponent-part floating-suffixopt
             fractional-constant :
                  digit-sequence . digit-sequence
                  digit-sequence .
                  . digit-sequence
             exponent-part :
                 e signopt digit-sequence
                 E signopt digit-sequence

             sign : one of
                  +â
             digit-sequence :
                   digit
                   digit-sequence digit
             floating-suffix: one of
                   f F




                                                        22
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



        A decimal point ( . ) is not needed if the exponent part is present. No white space may appear anywhere
        within a floating-point constant, including before a suffix. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted as
        a unary operator and is not part of the floating-point constant

4.1.5   Vectors
        The OpenGL Shading Language includes data types for generic 2-, 3-, and 4-component vectors of
        floating-point values, integers, or Booleans. Floating-point vector variables can be used to store colors,
        normals, positions, texture coordinates, texture lookup results and the like. Boolean vectors can be used
        for component-wise comparisons of numeric vectors. Some examples of vector declaration are:
           vec2 texcoord1, texcoord2;
           vec3 position;
           vec4 myRGBA;
           ivec2 textureLookup;
           bvec3 less;

        Initialization of vectors can be done with constructors, which are discussed shortly.

4.1.6   Matrices
        The OpenGL Shading Language has built-in types for 2Ã2, 2Ã3, 2Ã4, 3Ã2, 3Ã3, 3Ã4, 4Ã2, 4Ã3, and 4Ã4
        matrices of floating-point numbers. The first number in the type is the number of columns, the second is
        the number of rows. Example matrix declarations:
           mat2 mat2D;
           mat3 optMatrix;
           mat4 view, projection;
           mat4x4 view; // an alternate way of declaring a mat4
           mat3x2 m;     // a matrix with 3 columns and 2 rows

        Initialization of matrix values is done with constructors (described in Section 5.4 âConstructorsâ ) in
        column-major order.

4.1.7   Samplers
        Sampler types (e.g. sampler2D) are effectively opaque handles to textures and their filters. They are used
        with the built-in texture functions (described in Section 8.7 âTexture Lookup Functionsâ ) to specify
        which texture to access and how it is to be filtered. They can only be declared as function parameters or
        uniform variables (see Section 4.3.5 âUniformâ ). Except for array indexing, structure field selection,
        and parentheses, samplers are not allowed to be operands in expressions. Samplers aggregated into arrays
        within a shader (using square brackets [ ]) can only be indexed with integral constant expressions (see
        Section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ). Samplers cannot be treated as l-values; hence cannot be used as
        out or inout function parameters, nor can they be assigned into. As uniforms, they are initialized only
        with the OpenGL API; they cannot be declared with an initializer in a shader. As function parameters,
        only samplers may be passed to samplers of matching type. This enables consistency checking between
        shader texture accesses and OpenGL texture state before a shader is run.




                                                       23
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.8   Structures
        User-defined types can be created by aggregating other already defined types into a structure using the
        struct keyword. For example,
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           } lightVar;

        In this example, light becomes the name of the new type, and lightVar becomes a variable of type light.
        To declare variables of the new type, use its name (without the keyword struct).
           light lightVar2;

        More formally, structures are declared as follows. However, the complete correct grammar is as given in
        Section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ .

             struct-definition :
                  qualifieropt struct nameopt { member-list } declaratorsopt ;

             member-list :
                member-declaration;
                member-declaration member-list;
             member-declaration :
                basic-type declarators;
        where name becomes the user-defined type, and can be used to declare variables to be of this new type.
        The name shares the same name space as other variables, types, and functions, with the same scoping
        rules. The optional qualifier only applies to any declarators, and is not part of the type being defined for
        name.
        Structures must have at least one member declaration. Member declarators may contain precision
        qualifiers, but may not contain any other qualifiers. Nor do they contain any bit fields. Member types
        must be already defined (there are no forward references). Member declarations cannot contain
        initializers. Member declarators can contain arrays. Such arrays must have a size specified, and the size
        must be an integral constant expression that's greater than zero (see Section 4.3.3 âConstant
        Expressionsâ ). Each level of structure has its own name space for names given in member declarators;
        such names need only be unique within that name space.
        Anonymous structures are not supported. Embedded structure definitions are not supported.

                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



           struct S { float f; };

           struct T {
                  S;              // Error: anonymous structures disallowed
                  struct { ... }; // Error: embedded structures disallowed
                  S s;            // Okay: nested structures with name are allowed
           };

        Structures can be initialized at declaration time using constructors, as discussed in Section 5.4.3
        âStructure Constructorsâ .

4.1.9   Arrays
        Variables of the same type can be aggregated into arrays by declaring a name followed by brackets ( [ ] )
        enclosing an optional size. When an array size is specified in a declaration, it must be an integral constant
        expression (see Section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ ) greater than zero. If an array is indexed with an
        expression that is not an integral constant expression, or if an array is passed as an argument to a function,
        then its size must be declared before any such use. It is legal to declare an array without a size and then
        later re-declare the same name as an array of the same type and specify a size. It is illegal to declare an
        array with a size, and then later (in the same shader) index the same array with an integral constant
        expression greater than or equal to the declared size. It is also illegal to index an array with a negative
        constant expression. Arrays declared as formal parameters in a function declaration must specify a size.
        Undefined behavior results from indexing an array with a non-constant expression thatâs greater than or
        equal to the arrayâs size or less than 0. Only one-dimensional arrays may be declared. All basic types and
        structures can be formed into arrays. Some examples are:
           float frequencies[3];
           uniform vec4 lightPosition[4];
           light lights[];
           const int numLights = 2;
           light lights[numLights];

        An array type can be formed by specifying a type followed by square brackets ([ ]) and including a size:
           float[5]

        This type can be used anywhere any other type can be used, including as the return value from a function
           float[5] foo() { }

        as a constructor of an array
           float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1)

        as an unnamed parameter
           void foo(float[5])

        and as an alternate way of declaring a variable or function parameter.




                                                        25
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



   float[5] a;

It is an error to declare arrays of arrays:
   float a[5][3];          // illegal
   float[5] a[3];          // illegal


Arrays can have initializers formed from array constructors:
   float a[5] = float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1);
   float a[5] = float[](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1); // same thing

Unsized arrays can be explicitly sized by an initializer at declaration time:
   float a[5];
   ...
   float b[] = a; // b is explicitly size 5
   float b[5] = a; // means the same thing

However, implicitly sized arrays cannot be assigned to. Note, this is a rare case that initializers and
assignments appear to have different semantics.
Arrays know the number of elements they contain. This can be obtained by using the length method:
   a.length();        // returns 5 for the above declarations

The length method cannot be called on an array that has not been explicitly sized.




                                                26
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.10 Implicit Conversions
       In some situations, an expression and its type will be implicitly converted to a different type. The
       following table shows all allowed implicit conversions:

                 Type of expression            Can be implicitly converted to
                          int                                  float
                          uint
                         ivec2                                 vec2
                         uvec2
                         ivec3                                 vec3
                         uvec3
                         ivec4                                 vec4
                         uvec4

       There are no implicit array or structure conversions. For example, an array of int cannot be implicitly
       converted to an array of float. There are no implicit conversions between signed and unsigned integers.
       When an implicit conversion is done, it is not a re-interpretation of the expression's bit pattern, but a
       conversion of its value to an equivalent value in the new type. For example, the integer value -5 will be
       converted to the floating-point value -5.0. Integer values having more bits of precision than a floating
       point mantissa will lose precision when converted to float.
       The conversions in the table above are done only as indicated by other sections of this specification.

4.2    Scoping
       The scope of a variable is determined by where it is declared. If it is declared outside all function
       definitions, it has global scope, which starts from where it is declared and persists to the end of the shader
       it is declared in. If it is declared in a while test or a for statement, then it is scoped to the end of the
       following sub-statement. Otherwise, if it is declared as a statement within a compound statement, it is
       scoped to the end of that compound statement. If it is declared as a parameter in a function definition, it is
       scoped until the end of that function definition. A function body has a scope nested inside the functionâs
       definition. The if statementâs expression does not allow new variables to be declared, hence does not
       form a new scope.




                                                       27
                                                                              4 Variables and Types



Within a declaration, the scope of a name starts immediately after the initializer if present or immediately
after the name being declared if not. Several examples:
   int x = 1;
   {
          int x = 2, y = x; // y is initialized to 2
   }

   struct S
   {
          int x;
   };

   {
            S S = S(0,0); // 'S' is only visible as a struct and constructor
            S;            // 'S' is now visible as a variable
   }

   int x = x;                  // Error if x has not been previously defined.

All variable names, structure type names, and function names in a given scope share the same name space.
Function names can be redeclared in the same scope, with the same or different parameters, without error.
An implicitly sized array can be re-declared in the same scope as an array of the same base type.
Otherwise, within one compilation unit, a declared name cannot be redeclared in the same scope; doing so
results in a redeclaration error. If a nested scope redeclares a name used in an outer scope, it hides all
existing uses of that name. There is no way to access the hidden name or make it unhidden, without
exiting the scope that hid it.
The built-in functions are scoped in a scope outside the global scope users declare global variables in.
That is, a shader's global scope, available for user-defined functions and global variables, is nested inside
the scope containing the built-in functions. When a function name is redeclared in a nested scope, it hides
all functions declared with that name in the outer scope. Function declarations (prototypes) cannot occur
inside of functions; they must be at global scope, or for the built-in functions, outside the global scope.
Shared globals are global variables declared with the same name in independently compiled units
(shaders) of the same language (vertex or fragment) that are linked together to make a single program.
Shared globals share the same name space, and must be declared with the same type. They will share the
same storage. Shared global arrays must have the same base type and the same explicit size. An array
implicitly sized in one shader can be explicitly sized by another shader. If no shader has an explicit size
for the array, the largest implicit size is used. Scalars must have exactly the same type name and type
definition. Structures must have the same name, sequence of type names, and type definitions, and field
names to be considered the same type. This rule applies recursively for nested or embedded types. All
initializers for a shared global must have the same value, or a link error will result.

                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



4.3   Storage Qualifiers
      Variable declarations may have one storage qualifier specified in front of the type. These are summarized
      as

             Qualifier                Meaning
             < none: default >        local read/write memory, or an input parameter to a function
             const                    a compile-time constant, or a function parameter that is read-only
             in                       linkage into a shader from a previous stage, variable is copied in
             centroid in              linkage with centroid based interpolation
             out                      linkage out of a shader to a subsequent stage, variable is copied out
             centroid out             linkage with centroid based interpolation
             attribute                deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and OpenGL for per-vertex
                                      data
             uniform                  value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms
                                      form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application
             varying                  deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and a fragment shader for
             centroid varying         interpolated data


      Outputs from a vertex shader (out) and inputs to a fragment shader (in) can be further qualified with one
      or more of these interpolation qualifiers

             Qualifier                    Meaning
             smooth                       perspective correct interpolation
             flat                         no interpolation
             noperspective                linear interpolation


      These interpolation qualifiers may only precede the qualifiers in, centroid in, out, or centroid out in a
      declaration. They do not apply to the deprecated storage qualifiers varying or centroid varying. They
      also do not apply to inputs into a vertex shader or outputs from a fragment shader.
      Local variables can only use the const storage qualifier.
      Function parameters can use const, in, and out qualifiers, but as parameter qualifiers. Parameter
      qualifiers are discussed in Section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.
      Function return types and structure fields do not use storage qualifiers.
      Data types for communication from one run of a shader executable to its next run (to communicate
      between fragments or between vertices) do not exist. This would prevent parallel execution of the same
      shader executable on multiple vertices or fragments.




                                                      29
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        Initializers may only be used in declarations of globals with no storage qualifier, with a const qualifier or
        with a uniform qualifier. Global variables without storage qualifiers that are not initialized in their
        declaration or by the application will not be initialized by OpenGL, but rather will enter main() with
        undefined values.

4.3.1   Default Storage Qualifier
        If no qualifier is present on a global variable, then the variable has no linkage to the application or shaders
        running on other pipeline stages. For either global or local unqualified variables, the declaration will
        appear to allocate memory associated with the processor it targets. This variable will provide read/write
        access to this allocated memory.

4.3.2   Const
        Named compile-time constants can be declared using the const qualifier. Any variables qualified as
        constant are read-only variables for that shader. Declaring variables as constant allows more descriptive
        shaders than using hard-wired numerical constants. The const qualifier can be used with any of the basic
        data types. It is an error to write to a const variable outside of its declaration, so they must be initialized
        when declared. For example,
            const vec3 zAxis = vec3 (0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

        Structure fields may not be qualified with const. Structure variables can be declared as const, and
        initialized with a structure constructor.
        Initializers for const declarations must be constant expressions, as defined in Section 4.3.3 âConstant
        Expressions.â

4.3.3   Constant Expressions
        A constant expression is one of
        â¢   a literal value (e.g., 5 or true)
        â¢   a global or local variable qualified as const (i.e. not including function parameters)
        â¢   an expression formed by an operator on operands that are all constant expressions, including getting an
            element or length of a constant array, or a field of a constant structure, or components of a constant
            vector.
        â¢   a constructor whose arguments are all constant expressions
        â¢   a built-in function call whose arguments are all constant expressions, with the exception of the texture
            lookup functions, the noise functions, and ftransform. The built-in functions dFdx, dFdy, and
            fwidth must return 0 when evaluated inside an initializer with an argument that is a constant
            expression.
        Function calls to user-defined functions (non-built-in functions) cannot be used to form constant
        expressions.
        An integral constant expression is a constant expression that evaluates to a scalar signed or unsigned
        integer.




                                                         30
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        Constant expressions will be evaluated in an invariant way so as to create the same value in multiple
        shaders when the same constant expressions appear in those shaders. See section 4.6.1 âThe Invariant
        Qualifierâ for more details on how to create invariant expressions.

4.3.4   Inputs
        Shader input variables are declared with the in storage qualifier or the centroid in storage qualifier. They
        form the input interface between previous stages of the OpenGL pipeline and the declaring shader. Input
        variables must be declared at global scope. Values from the previous pipeline stage are copied into input
        variables at the beginning of shader execution. Variables declared as in or centroid in may not be written
        to during shader execution.
        Vertex shader input variables (or attributes) receive per-vertex data. They are declared in a vertex shader
        with the in qualifier or the deprecated attribute qualifier. It is an error to use centroid in in a vertex
        shader. The values copied in are established by the OpenGL API. It is an error to use attribute in a non-
        vertex shader. Vertex shader inputs can only be float, floating-point vectors, matrices, signed and
        unsigned integers and integer vectors. They cannot be arrays or structures.
        Example declarations in a vertex shader:
           in vec4 position;
           in vec3 normal;
           in vec2 texCoord;

        See Section 7 âBuilt-in Variablesâ for a list of the built-in input names.
        Fragment shader inputs (or varyings) get per-fragment values, typically interpolated from a previous
        stage's outputs. They are declared in fragment shaders with the in storage qualifier, the centroid in
        storage qualifier, or the deprecated varying and centroid varying storage qualifiers. Fragment inputs
        can only be signed and unsigned integers and integer vectors, float, floating-point vectors, matrices, or
        arrays of these. Structures cannot be input.
        Fragment inputs are declared as in the following examples:
           in vec3 normal;
           centroid in vec2 TexCoord;
           invariant centroid in vec4 Color;
           noperspective out float temperature;
           flat in vec3 myColor;
           centroid noperspective in vec2 myTexCoord;


        It is expected that graphics hardware will have a small number of fixed vector locations for passing vertex
        inputs. Therefore, the OpenGL Shading language defines each non-matrix input variable as taking up one
        such vector location . There is an implementation dependent limit on the number of locations that can be
        used, and if this is exceeded it will cause a link error. (Declared input variables that are not statically used
        do not count against this limit.) A scalar input counts the same amount against this limit as a vec4, so
        applications may want to consider packing groups of four unrelated float inputs together into a vector to
        better utilize the capabilities of the underlying hardware. A matrix input will use up multiple locations.
        The number of locations used will equal the number of columns in the matrix.




                                                         31
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



4.3.5   Uniform
        The uniform qualifier is used to declare global variables whose values are the same across the entire
        primitive being processed. All uniform variables are read-only and are initialized externally either at link
        time or through the API. The link time initial value is either the value of the variable's initializer, if
        present, or 0 if no initializer is present. Sampler types cannot have initializers.
        Example declarations are:
           uniform vec4 lightPosition;
           uniform vec3 color = vec3(0.7, 0.7, 0.2);                    // value assigned at link time

        The uniform qualifier can be used with any of the basic data types, or when declaring a variable whose
        type is a structure, or an array of any of these.
        There is an implementation dependent limit on the amount of storage for uniforms that can be used for
        each type of shader and if this is exceeded it will cause a compile-time or link-time error. Uniform
        variables that are declared but not used do not count against this limit. The number of user-defined
        uniform variables and the number of built-in uniform variables that are used within a shader are added
        together to determine whether available uniform storage has been exceeded.
        If multiple shaders are linked together, then they will share a single global uniform name space. Hence,
        the types and initializers of uniform variables with the same name must match across all shaders that are
        linked into a single executable. It is legal for some shaders to provide an initializer for a particular
        uniform variable, while another shader does not, but all provided initializers must be equal.

4.3.6   Outputs
        Shader output variables are declared with the out or centroid out storage qualifiers. They form the
        output interface between the declaring shader and the subsequent stages of the OpenGL pipeline. Output
        variables must be declared at global scope. During shader execution they will behave as normal
        unqualified global variables. Their values are copied out to the subsequent pipeline stage on shader exit.
        There is not an inout storage qualifier at global scope for declaring a single variable name as both input
        and output to a shader. Output variables must be declared with different names than input variables.
        Vertex output variables output per-vertex data and are declared using the out storage qualifier, the
        centroid out storage qualifier, or the deprecated varying storage qualifier. They can only be float,
        floating-point vectors, matrices, signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays of any these. If a
        vertex output is a signed or unsigned integer or integer vector, then it must be qualified with the
        interpolation qualifier flat. Structures cannot be output.
        Vertex outputs are declared as in the following examples:




                                                        32
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



           out vec3 normal;
           centroid out vec2 TexCoord;
           invariant centroid out vec4 Color;
           noperspective out float temperature; // varying is deprecated
           flat out vec3 myColor;
           noperspective centroid out vec2 myTexCoord;

        Fragment outputs output per-fragment data and are declared using the out storage qualifier. It is an error
        to use centroid out in a fragment shader. Fragment outputs can only be float, floating-point vectors,
        signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays of any these. Matrices and structures cannot be
        output. Fragment outputs are declared as in the following examples:
           out vec4 FragmentColor;
           out uint Luminosity;

4.3.7   Interpolation
        The presence of and type of interpolation is controlled by the storage qualifiers centroid in and centroid
        out, and by the optional interpolation qualifiers smooth, flat, and noperspective as well as by default
        behaviors established through the OpenGL API when no interpolation qualifier is present. When an
        interpolation qualifier is used, it overrides settings established through the OpenGL API. It is a compile-
        time error to use more than one interpolation qualifier.
        The following predeclared variables can be redeclared with an interpolation qualifier:
         Vertex language:
           gl_FrontColor                    (deprecated)
           gl_BackColor                     (deprecated)
           gl_FrontSecondaryColor           (deprecated)
           gl_BackSecondaryColor            (deprecated)

         Fragment language:
           gl_Color          (deprecated)
           gl_SecondaryColor (deprecated)

        For example,
           in vec4 gl_Color;                // predeclared by the fragment language
           flat in vec4 gl_Color;           // redeclared by user to be flat

        If gl_Color is redeclared with an interpolation qualifier, then gl_FrontColor and gl_BackColor (if they
        are written to) must also be redeclared with the same interpolation qualifier, and vice versa. If
        gl_SecondaryColor is redeclared with an interpolation qualifier, then gl_FrontSecondaryColor and
        gl_BackSecondaryColor (if they are written to) must also be redeclared with the same interpolation
        qualifier, and vice versa. This qualifier matching on predeclared variables is only required for variables
        that are statically used within the shaders in a program.




                                                       33
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



      A variable qualified as flat will not be interpolated. Instead, it will have the same value for every
      fragment within a triangle. This value will come from a single provoking vertex, as described by the
      OpenGL Graphics System Specification. User-declared variables can be qualified as flat and the
      predeclared variables listed above and can be redeclared as flat. It is an error to declare any other built-in
      variable as flat. A variable may be qualified as flat centroid, which will mean the same thing as
      qualifying it only as flat.
      A variable qualified as smooth will be interpolated in a perspective-correct manner over the primitive
      being rendered. Interpolation in a perspective correct manner is specified in equations 3.6 and 3.8 in the
      OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0.
      A variable qualified as noperspective must be interpolated linearly in screen space, as described in
      equation 3.7 and the approximation that follows equation 3.8 in the OpenGL Graphics System
      Specification, Version 3.0.
      This paragraph only applies if interpolation is being done: If single-sampling, the value is interpolated to
      the pixel's center, and the centroid qualifier, if present, is ignored. If multi-sampling and the variable is
      not qualified with centroid, then the value must be interpolated to the pixel's center, or anywhere within
      the pixel, or to one of the pixel's samples. If multi-sampling and the variable is qualified with centroid,
      then the value must be interpolated to a point that lies in both the pixel and in the primitive being
      rendered, or to one of the pixel's samples that falls within the primitive. Due to the less regular location of
      centroids, their derivatives may be less accurate than non-centroid interpolated variables.
      The type and presence of the interpolation qualifiers and storage qualifiers and invariant qualifiers of
      variables with the same name declared in linked vertex and fragments shaders must match, otherwise the
      link command will fail. Only those input variables read in the fragment shader executable must be written
      to by the vertex shader executable; declaring superfluous output variables in a vertex shader is
      permissible.




4.4   Parameter Qualifiers
      Parameters can have these qualifiers.

        Parameter qualifiers are discussed in more detail in Section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.

4.5     Precision and Precision Qualifiers
        Precision qualifiers are added for code portability with OpenGL ES, not for functionality. They have the
        same syntax as in OpenGL ES, as described below, but they have no semantic meaning, which includes no
        effect on the precision used to store or operate on variables.
        If an extension adds in the same semantics and functionality in the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification for
        precision qualifiers, then the extension is allowed to reuse the keywords below for that purpose.

4.5.1   Range and Precision
        Section number reserved for future use.

4.5.2   Precision Qualifiers
        Any floating point or any integer declaration can have the type preceded by one of these precision
        qualifiers:

                 Qualifier             Meaning
                 highp                 None.
                 mediump               None.
                 lowp                  None.


        For example:
           lowp float color;
           out mediump vec2 P;
           lowp ivec2 foo(lowp mat3);
           highp mat4 m;

        Literal constants do not have precision qualifiers. Neither do Boolean variables. Neither do floating point
        constructors nor integer constructors when none of the constructor arguments have precision qualifiers.
        Precision qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not effect the basic type of the variable. In particular,
        there are no constructors for precision conversions; constructors only convert types. Similarly, precision
        qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not contribute to function overloading based on parameter types. As
        discussed in the next chapter, function input and output is done through copies, and therefore qualifiers do
        not have to match.
        The same object declared in different shaders that are linked together must have the same precision
        qualification. This applies to inputs, outputs, uniforms, and globals.

4.5.3   Default Precision Qualifiers
        The precision statement




                                                       35
                                                                                         4 Variables and Types



           precision precision-qualifier type;

        can be used to establish a default precision qualifier. The type field can be either int or float, and the
        precision-qualifier can be lowp, mediump, or highp. Any other types or qualifiers will result in an error.
        If type is float, the directive applies to non-precision-qualified floating point type (scalar, vector, and
        matrix) declarations. If type is int, the directive applies to all non-precision-qualified integer type (scalar,
        vector, signed, and unsigned) declarations. This includes global variable declarations, function return
        declarations, function parameter declarations, and local variable declarations.
        Non-precision qualified declarations will use the precision qualifier specified in the most recent precision
        statement that is still in scope. The precision statement has the same scoping rules as variable
        declarations. If it is declared inside a compound statement, its effect stops at the end of the innermost
        statement it was declared in. Precision statements in nested scopes override precision statements in outer
        scopes. Multiple precision statements for the same basic type can appear inside the same scope, with later
        statements overriding earlier statements within that scope.
        The vertex language has the following predeclared globally scoped default precision statements:
           precision highp float;
           precision highp int;

        The fragment language has the following predeclared globally scoped default precision statement:
           precision mediump int;

        The fragment language has no default precision qualifier for floating point types. Hence for float, floating
        point vector and matrix variable declarations, either the declaration must include a precision qualifier or
        the default float precision must have been previously declared.

4.5.4   Available Precision Qualifiers
        The built-in macro GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH is defined to 1:
           #define GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH 1

        This macro is available in both the vertex and fragment languages.

4.6     Variance and the Invariant Qualifier
        In this section, variance refers to the possibility of getting different values from the same expression in
        different programs. For example, say two vertex shaders, in different programs, each set gl_Position with
        the same expression in both shaders, and the input values into that expression are the same when both
        shaders run. It is possible, due to independent compilation of the two shaders, that the values assigned to
        gl_Position are not exactly the same when the two shaders run. In this example, this can cause problems
        with alignment of geometry in a multi-pass algorithm.
        In general, such variance between shaders is allowed. When such variance does not exist for a particular
        output variable, that variable is said to be invariant.




                                                         36
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



4.6.1   The Invariant Qualifier
        To ensure that a particular output variable is invariant, it is necessary to use the invariant qualifier. It can
        either be used to qualify a previously declared variable as being invariant
            invariant gl_Position;             // make existing gl_Position be invariant

            out vec3 Color;
            invariant Color;                   // make existing Color be invariant

        or as part of a declaration when a variable is declared
            invariant centroid out vec3 Color;

        The invariant qualifier must appear before any interpolation qualifiers or storage qualifiers when
        combined with a declaration. Only variables output from a shader can be candidates for invariance. This
        includes user-defined output variables and the built-in output variables. For variables leaving a vertex
        shader and coming into a fragment shader with the same name, the invariant keyword has to be used in
        both the vertex and fragment shaders.
        The invariant keyword can be followed by a comma separated list of previously declared identifiers. All
        uses of invariant must be at the global scope, and before any use of the variables being declared as
        invariant.
        To guarantee invariance of a particular output variable across two programs, the following must also be
        true:
        â¢   The output variable is declared as invariant in both programs.
        â¢   The same values must be input to all shader input variables consumed by expressions and flow control
            contributing to the value assigned to the output variable.
        â¢   The texture formats, texel values, and texture filtering are set the same way for any texture function
            calls contributing to the value of the output variable.
        â¢   All input values are all operated on in the same way. All operations in the consuming expressions and
            any intermediate expressions must be the same, with the same order of operands and same
            associativity, to give the same order of evaluation. Intermediate variables and functions must be
            declared as the same type with the same explicit or implicit precision qualifiers. Any control flow
            affecting the output value must be the same, and any expressions consumed to determine this control
            flow must also follow these invariance rules.
        â¢   All the data flow and control flow leading to setting the invariant output variable reside in a single
            compilation unit.
        Essentially, all the data flow and control flow leading to an invariant output must match.
        Initially, by default, all output variables are allowed to be variant. To force all output variables to be
        invariant, use the pragma




                                                        37
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



           #pragma STDGL invariant(all)

        before all declarations in a shader. If this pragma is used after the declaration of any variables or
        functions, then the set of outputs that behave as invariant is undefined. It is an error to use this pragma in
        a fragment shader.
        Generally, invariance is ensured at the cost of flexibility in optimization, so performance can be degraded
        by use of invariance. Hence, use of this pragma is intended as a debug aid, to avoid individually declaring
        all output variables as invariant.

4.6.2   Invariance of Constant Expressions
        Invariance must be guaranteed for constant expressions. A particular constant expression must evaluate to
        the same result if it appears again in the same shader or a different shader. This includes the same
        expression appearing in both a vertex and fragment shader or the same expression appearing in different
        vertex or fragment shaders.
        Constant expressions must evaluate to the same result when operated on as already described above for
        invariant variables.

4.7     Order of Qualification
        When multiple qualifications are present, they must follow a strict order. This order is as follows.
                 invariant-qualifier interpolation-qualifier storage-qualifier precision qualifier
                 storage-qualifier parameter-qualifier precision qualifier

      There is no address-of operator nor a dereference operator. There is no typecast operator; constructors
      are used instead.

                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



5.2     Array Operations
        These are now described in Section 5.7 âStructure and Array Operationsâ.

5.3     Function Calls
        If a function returns a value, then a call to that function may be used as an expression, whose type will be
        the type that was used to declare or define the function.
        Function definitions and calling conventions are discussed in Section 6.1 âFunction Definitionsâ .

5.4     Constructors
        Constructors use the function call syntax, where the function name is a type, and the call makes an object
        of that type. Constructors are used the same way in both initializers and expressions. (See Section 9
        âShading Language Grammarâ for details.) The parameters are used to initialize the constructed value.
        Constructors can be used to request a data type conversion to change from one scalar type to another
        scalar type, or to build larger types out of smaller types, or to reduce a larger type to a smaller type.
        In general, constructors are not built-in functions with predetermined prototypes. For arrays and
        structures, there must be exactly one argument in the constructor for each element or field. For the other
        types, the arguments must provide a sufficient number of components to perform the initialization, and it
        is an error to include so many arguments that they cannot all be used. Detailed rules follow. The
        prototypes actually listed below are merely a subset of examples.

5.4.1   Conversion and Scalar Constructors
        Converting between scalar types is done as the following prototypes indicate:
           int(bool)         //   converts    a Boolean value to an int
           int(float)        //   converts    a float value to an int
           float(bool)       //   converts    a Boolean value to a float
           float(int)        //   converts    a signed integer value to a float
           bool(float)       //   converts    a float value to a Boolean
           bool(int)         //   converts    a signed integer value to a Boolean
           uint(bool)        //   converts    a Boolean value to an unsigned integer
           uint(float)       //   converts    a float value to an unsigned integer
           uint(int)         //   converts    a signed integer value to an unsigned integer
           int(uint)         //   converts    an unsigned integer to a signed integer
           bool(uint)        //   converts    an unsigned integer value to a Boolean value
           float(uint)       //   converts    an unsigned integer value to a float value

        When constructors are used to convert a float to an int or uint, the fractional part of the floating-point
        value is dropped. It is undefined to convert a negative floating point value to an uint.
        When a constructor is used to convert an int, uint, or a float to a bool, 0 and 0.0 are converted to false,
        and non-zero values are converted to true. When a constructor is used to convert a bool to an int, uint,
        or float, false is converted to 0 or 0.0, and true is converted to 1 or 1.0.

                                                                                  5 Operators and Expressions



        The constructor int(uint) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will change the argument's
        value if its sign bit is set. The constructor uint(int) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will
        change its value if it is negative.
        Identity constructors, like float(float) are also legal, but of little use.
        Scalar constructors with non-scalar parameters can be used to take the first element from a non-scalar.
        For example, the constructor float(vec3) will select the first component of the vec3 parameter.

5.4.2   Vector and Matrix Constructors
        Constructors can be used to create vectors or matrices from a set of scalars, vectors, or matrices. This
        includes the ability to shorten vectors.
        If there is a single scalar parameter to a vector constructor, it is used to initialize all components of the
        constructed vector to that scalarâs value. If there is a single scalar parameter to a matrix constructor, it is
        used to initialize all the components on the matrixâs diagonal, with the remaining components initialized
        to 0.0.
        If a vector is constructed from multiple scalars, one or more vectors, or one or more matrices, or a mixture
        of these, the vectors' components will be constructed in order from the components of the arguments. The
        arguments will be consumed left to right, and each argument will have all it's components consumed, in
        order, before any components from the next argument are consumed. Similarly for constructing a matrix
        from multiple scalars or vectors, or a mixture of these. Matrix components will be constructed and
        consumed in column major order. In these cases, there must be enough components provided in the
        arguments to provide an initializer for every component in the constructed value. It is an error to provide
        extra arguments beyond this last used argument.
        If a matrix is constructed from a matrix, then each component (column i, row j) in the result that has a
        corresponding component (column i, row j) in the argument will be initialized from there. All other
        components will be initialized to the identity matrix. If a matrix argument is given to a matrix constructor,
        it is an error to have any other arguments.
        If the basic type (bool, int, or float) of a parameter to a constructor does not match the basic type of the
        object being constructed, the scalar construction rules (above) are used to convert the parameters.




                                                           41
                                                                        5 Operators and Expressions



Some useful vector constructors are as follows:
   vec3(float)        // initializes each component of with the float
   vec4(ivec4)        // makes a vec4 with component-wise conversion
   vec4(mat2)         // the vec4 is column 0 followed by column 1

   vec2(float, float)                              // initializes a vec2 with 2 floats
   ivec3(int, int, int)                            // initializes an ivec3 with 3 ints
   bvec4(int, int, float, float)                   // uses 4 Boolean conversions

   vec2(vec3)                   // drops the third component of a vec3
   vec3(vec4)                   // drops the fourth component of a vec4

   vec3(vec2, float)            // vec3.x = vec2.x, vec3.y = vec2.y, vec3.z = float
   vec3(float, vec2)            // vec3.x = float, vec3.y = vec2.x, vec3.z = vec2.y
   vec4(vec3, float)
   vec4(float, vec3)
   vec4(vec2, vec2)

Some examples of these are:
   vec4 color = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
   vec4 rgba = vec4(1.0);    // sets each component to 1.0
   vec3 rgb   = vec3(color); // drop the 4th component

To initialize the diagonal of a matrix with all other elements set to zero:
   mat2(float)
   mat3(float)
   mat4(float)

That is, result[i][j] is set to the float argument for all i = j and set to 0 for all iâ  j.

                                                                                 5 Operators and Expressions



        To initialize a matrix by specifying vectors or scalars, the components are assigned to the matrix elements
        in column-major order.
           mat2(vec2, vec2);                         //   one     column   per   argument
           mat3(vec3, vec3, vec3);                   //   one     column   per   argument
           mat4(vec4, vec4, vec4, vec4);             //   one     column   per   argument
           mat3x2(vec2, vec2, vec2);                 //   one     column   per   argument

           mat2(float, float,                // first column
                float, float);               // second column

           mat3(float, float, float,                 // first column
                float, float, float,                 // second column
                float, float, float);                // third column

           mat4(float,      float,    float,    float,       //   first column
                float,      float,    float,    float,       //   second column
                float,      float,    float,    float,       //   third column
                float,      float,    float,    float);      //   fourth column

           mat2x3(vec2, float,                // first column
                  vec2, float);               // second column

        A wide range of other possibilities exist, to construct a matrix from vectors and scalars, as long as enough
        components are present to initialize the matrix. To construct a matrix from a matrix:
           mat3x3(mat4x4);         // takes the upper-left 3x3 of the mat4x4
           mat2x3(mat4x2);         // takes the upper-left 2x2 of the mat4x4, last row is 0,0
           mat4x4(mat3x3);         // puts the mat3x3 in the upper-left, sets the lower right
                                   //    component to 1, and the rest to 0

5.4.3   Structure Constructors
        Once a structure is defined, and its type is given a name, a constructor is available with the same name to
        construct instances of that structure. For example:
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           };

           light lightVar = light(3.0, vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0));

        The arguments to the constructor will be used to set the structure's fields, in order, using one argument per
        field. Each argument must be the same type as the field it sets, or be a type that can be converted to the
        field's type according to Section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversions.â
        Structure constructors can be used as initializers or in expressions.




                                                        43
                                                                            5 Operators and Expressions



5.4.4   Array Constructors
        Array types can also be used as constructor names, which can then be used in expressions or initializers.
        For example,

           const float c[3] = float[3](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);
           const float d[3] = float[](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);

           float g;
           ...
           float a[5] = float[5](g, 1, g, 2.3, g);
           float b[3];

           b = float[3](g, g + 1.0, g + 2.0);

        There must be exactly the same number of arguments as the size of the array being constructed. If no size
        is present in the constructor, then the array is explicitly sized to the number of arguments provided. The
        arguments are assigned in order, starting at element 0, to the elements of the constructed array. Each
        argument must be the same type as the element type of the array, or be a type that can be converted to the
        element type of the array according to Section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversions.â

5.5     Vector Components
        The names of the components of a vector are denoted by a single letter. As a notational convenience,
        several letters are associated with each component based on common usage of position, color or texture
        coordinate vectors. The individual components of a vector can be selected by following the variable
        name with period ( . ) and then the component name.
        The component names supported are:

              {x, y, z, w}       Useful when accessing vectors that represent points or normals
              {r, g, b, a}             Useful when accessing vectors that represent colors
              {s, t, p, q}       Useful when accessing vectors that represent texture coordinates


        The component names x, r, and s are, for example, synonyms for the same (first) component in a vector.
        Note that the third component of the texture coordinate set, r in OpenGL, has been renamed p so as to
        avoid the confusion with r (for red) in a color.
        Accessing components beyond those declared for the vector type is an error so, for example:
           vec2 pos;
           pos.x // is legal
           pos.z // is illegal




                                                      44
                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



      The component selection syntax allows multiple components to be selected by appending their names
      (from the same name set) after the period ( . ).
         vec4 v4;
         v4.rgba;       //   is   a vec4 and the same as just using v4,
         v4.rgb;        //   is   a vec3,
         v4.b;          //   is   a float,
         v4.xy;         //   is   a vec2,
         v4.xgba;       //   is   illegal - the component names do not come from
                        //                  the same set.

      The order of the components can be different to swizzle them, or replicated:
         vec4 pos = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
         vec4 swiz= pos.wzyx; // swiz = (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
         vec4 dup = pos.xxyy; // dup = (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)

      This notation is more concise than the constructor syntax. To form an r-value, it can be applied to any
      expression that results in a vector r-value.
      The component group notation can occur on the left hand side of an expression.
         vec4 pos     = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
         pos.xw =     vec2(5.0, 6.0);         // pos = (5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0)
         pos.wx =     vec2(7.0, 8.0);         // pos = (8.0, 2.0, 3.0, 7.0)
         pos.xx =     vec2(3.0, 4.0);         // illegal - 'x' used twice
         pos.xy =     vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);    // illegal - mismatch between vec2 and vec3

      To form an l-value, swizzling must be applied to an l-value of vector type, contain no duplicate
      components, and it results in an l-value of scalar or vector type, depending on number of components
      specified.
      Array subscripting syntax can also be applied to vectors to provide numeric indexing. So in
         vec4       pos;

      pos[2] refers to the third element of pos and is equivalent to pos.z. This allows variable indexing into a
      vector, as well as a generic way of accessing components. Any integer expression can be used as the
      subscript. The first component is at index zero. Reading from or writing to a vector using a constant
      integral expression with a value that is negative or greater than or equal to the size of the vector is illegal.
      When indexing with non-constant expressions, behavior is undefined if the index is negative, or greater
      than or equal to the size of the vector.

5.6   Matrix Components
      The components of a matrix can be accessed using array subscripting syntax. Applying a single subscript
      to a matrix treats the matrix as an array of column vectors, and selects a single column, whose type is a
      vector of the same size as the matrix. The leftmost column is column 0. A second subscript would then
      operate on the resulting vector, as defined earlier for vectors. Hence, two subscripts select a column and
      then a row.




                                                       45
                                                                           5 Operators and Expressions



         mat4 m;
         m[1] = vec4(2.0);                    // sets the second column to all 2.0
         m[0][0] = 1.0;                       // sets the upper left element to 1.0
         m[2][3] = 2.0;                       // sets the 4th element of the third column to 2.0

      Behavior is undefined when accessing a component outside the bounds of a matrix with a non-constant
      expression. It is an error to access a matrix with a constant expression that is outside the bounds of the
      matrix.

5.7   Structure and Array Operations
      The fields of a structure and the length method of an array are selected using the period ( . ).
      In total, only the following operators are allowed to operate on arrays and structures as whole entities:

           field or method selector       .
           equality                       == !=
           assignment                     =
           indexing (arrays only)         []


      The equality operators and assignment operator are only allowed if the two operands are same size and
      type. Structure types must be of the same declared structure. Both array operands must be explicitly
      sized. When using the equality operators, two structures are equal if and only if all the fields are
      component-wise equal, and two arrays are equal if and only if all the elements are element-wise equal.
      Array elements are accessed using the array subscript operator ( [ ] ). An example of accessing an array
      element is
         diffuseColor += lightIntensity[3] * NdotL;

      Array indices start at zero. Array elements are accessed using an expression whose type is int or uint.
      Behavior is undefined if a shader subscripts an array with an index less than 0 or greater than or equal to
      the size the array was declared with.
      Arrays can also be accessed with the method operator ( . ) and the length method to query the size of the
      array:
         lightIntensity.length()               // return the size of the array



5.8   Assignments
      Assignments of values to variable names are done with the assignment operator ( = ):
         lvalue-expression = rvalue-expression




                                                      46
                                                                              5 Operators and Expressions



      The lvalue-expression evaluates to an l-value. The assignment operator stores the value of rvalue-
      expression into the l-value and returns an r-value with the type and precision of lvalue-expression. The
      lvalue-expression and rvalue-expression must have the same type, or the expression must have a type in
      the table in Section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that converts to the type of lvalue-expression, in which
      case an implicit conversion will be done on the rvalue-expression before the assignment is done. Any
      other desired type-conversions must be specified explicitly via a constructor. L-values must be writable.
      Variables that are built-in types, entire structures or arrays, structure fields, l-values with the field selector
      ( . ) applied to select components or swizzles without repeated fields, l-values within parentheses, and l-
      values dereferenced with the array subscript operator ( [ ] ) are all l-values. Other binary or unary
      expressions, function names, swizzles with repeated fields, and constants cannot be l-values. The ternary
      operator (?:) is also not allowed as an l-value.
      Expressions on the left of an assignment are evaluated before expressions on the right of the assignment.
      The other assignment operators are
      â¢    add into (+=)
      â¢    subtract from (-=)
      â¢    multiply into (*=)
      â¢    divide into (/=)
      â¢    modulus into (%=)
      â¢    left shift by (<<=)
      â¢    right shift by (>>=)
      â¢    and into (&=)
      â¢    inclusive-or into (|=)
      â¢    exclusive-or into (^=)
      where the general expression

           lvalue op= expression

      is equivalent to

           lvalue = lvalue op expression

      where op is as described below, and the l-value and expression must satisfy the semantic requirements of
      both op and equals (=).
      Reading a variable before writing (or initializing) it is legal, however the value is undefined.

5.9   Expressions
      Expressions in the shading language are built from the following:
      â¢   Constants of type bool, int, uint, float, all vector types, and all matrix types.




                                                        47
                                                                      5 Operators and Expressions



â¢   Constructors of all types.
â¢   Variable names of all types.
â¢   An array name with the length method applied.
â¢   Subscripted array names.
â¢   Function calls that return values.
â¢   Component field selectors and array subscript results.
â¢   Parenthesized expression. Any expression can be parenthesized. Parentheses can be used to group
    operations. Operations within parentheses are done before operations across parentheses.
â¢   The arithmetic binary operators add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) operate on integer and
    floating-point scalars, vectors, and matrices. If one operand is floating-point based and the other is
    not, then the conversions from Section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ are applied to the non-floating-
    point-based operand. If the operands are integer types, they must both be signed or both be unsigned.
    All arithmetic binary operators result in the same fundamental type (signed integer, unsigned integer,
    or floating-point) as the operands they operate on, after operand type conversion. After conversion,
    the following cases are valid
    â¢   The two operands are scalars. In this case the operation is applied, resulting in a scalar.
    â¢   One operand is a scalar, and the other is a vector or matrix. In this case, the scalar operation is
        applied independently to each component of the vector or matrix, resulting in the same size vector
        or matrix.
    â¢   The two operands are vectors of the same size. In this case, the operation is done component-wise
        resulting in the same size vector.
    â¢   The operator is add (+), subtract (-), or divide (/), and the operands are matrices with the same
        number of rows and the same number of columns. In this case, the operation is done component-
        wise resulting in the same size matrix.
    â¢   The operator is multiply (*), where both operands are matrices or one operand is a vector and the
        other a matrix. A right vector operand is treated as a column vector and a left vector operand as a
        row vector. In all these cases, it is required that the number of columns of the left operand is equal
        to the number of rows of the right operand. Then, the multiply (*) operation does a linear
        algebraic multiply, yielding an object that has the same number of rows as the left operand and the
        same number of columns as the right operand. Section 5.10 âVector and Matrix Operationsâ
        explains in more detail how vectors and matrices are operated on.
    All other cases are illegal.
    Dividing by zero does not cause an exception but does result in an unspecified value. Use the built-in
    functions dot, cross, matrixCompMult, and outerProduct, to get, respectively, vector dot product,
    vector cross product, matrix component-wise multiplication, and the matrix product of a column
    vector times a row vector.

                                                                       5 Operators and Expressions



â¢   The operator modulus (%) operates on signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors. The operand
    types must both be signed or both be unsigned. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size. If
    one operand is a scalar and the other vector, then the scalar is applied component-wise to the vector,
    resulting in the same type as the vector. If both are vectors of the same size, the result is computed
    component-wise. The resulting value is undefined for any component computed with a second
    operand that is zero, while results for other components with non-zero second operands remain
    defined. If both operands are non-negative, then the remainder is non-negative. Results are undefined
    if one or both operands are negative. The operator modulus (%) is not defined for any other data
    types (non-integer types).
â¢   The arithmetic unary operators negate (-), post- and pre-increment and decrement (-- and ++) operate
    on integer or floating-point values (including vectors and matrices). All unary operators work
    component-wise on their operands. These result with the same type they operated on. For post- and
    pre-increment and decrement, the expression must be one that could be assigned to (an l-value). Pre-
    increment and pre-decrement add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents of the expression they operate on,
    and the value of the pre-increment or pre-decrement expression is the resulting value of that
    modification. Post-increment and post-decrement expressions add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents
    of the expression they operate on, but the resulting expression has the expressionâs value before the
    post-increment or post-decrement was executed.
â¢   The relational operators greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal (>=), and less than or
    equal (<=) operate only on scalar integer and scalar floating-point expressions. The result is scalar
    Boolean. Either the operandsâ types must match, or the conversions from Section 4.1.10 âImplicit
    Conversionsâ will be applied to the integer operand, after which the types must match. To do
    component-wise relational comparisons on vectors, use the built-in functions lessThan,
    lessThanEqual, greaterThan, and greaterThanEqual.
â¢   The equality operators equal (==), and not equal (!=) operate on all types. They result in a scalar
    Boolean. If the operand types do not match, then there must be a conversion from Section 4.1.10
    âImplicit Conversionsâ applied to one operand that can make them match, in which case this
    conversion is done. For vectors, matrices, structures, and arrays, all components, fields, or elements of
    one operand must equal the corresponding components, fields, or elements in the other operand for the
    operands to be considered equal. To get a vector of component-wise equality results for vectors, use
    the built-in functions equal and notEqual.
â¢   The logical binary operators and (&&), or ( | | ), and exclusive or (^^) operate only on two Boolean
    expressions and result in a Boolean expression. And (&&) will only evaluate the right hand operand
    if the left hand operand evaluated to true. Or ( | | ) will only evaluate the right hand operand if the left
    hand operand evaluated to false. Exclusive or (^^) will always evaluate both operands.
â¢   The logical unary operator not (!). It operates only on a Boolean expression and results in a Boolean
    expression. To operate on a vector, use the built-in function not.
â¢   The sequence ( , ) operator that operates on expressions by returning the type and value of the right-
    most expression in a comma separated list of expressions. All expressions are evaluated, in order,
    from left to right.




                                                 49
                                                                               5 Operators and Expressions



       â¢   The ternary selection operator (?:). It operates on three expressions (exp1 ? exp2 : exp3). This
           operator evaluates the first expression, which must result in a scalar Boolean. If the result is true, it
           selects to evaluate the second expression, otherwise it selects to evaluate the third expression. Only
           one of the second and third expressions is evaluated. The second and third expressions can be any
           type, as long their types match, or there is a conversion in Section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that
           can be applied to one of the expressions to make their types match. This resulting matching type is the
           type of the entire expression.
       â¢   The one's complement operator (~). The operand must be of type signed or unsigned integer or integer
           vector, and the result is the one's complement of its operand; each bit of each component is
           complemented, including any sign bits.
       â¢   The shift operators (<<) and (>>). For both operators, the operands must be signed or unsigned
           integers or integer vectors. One operand can be signed while the other is unsigned. In all cases, the
           resulting type will be the same type as the left operand. If the first operand is a scalar, the second
           operand has to be a scalar as well. If the first operand is a vector, the second operand must be a scalar
           or a vector, and the result is computed component-wise. The result is undefined if the right operand is
           negative, or greater than or equal to the number of bits in the left expression's base type. The value of
           E1 << E2 is E1 (interpreted as a bit pattern) left-shifted by E2 bits. The value of E1 >> E2 is E1 right-
           shifted by E2 bit positions. If E1 is a signed integer, the right-shift will extend the sign bit. If E1 is an
           unsigned integer, the right-shift will zero-extend.
       â¢   The bitwise operators and (&), exclusive-or (^), and inclusive-or (|). The operands must be of type
           signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size. If one
           operand is a scalar and the other a vector, the scalar is applied component-wise to the vector, resulting
           in the same type as the vector. The fundamental types of the operands (signed or unsigned) must
           match, and will be the resulting fundamental type. For and (&), the result is the bitwise-and function
           of the operands. For exclusive-or (^), the result is the bitwise exclusive-or function of the operands.
           For inclusive-or (|), the result is the bitwise inclusive-or function of the operands.
       For a complete specification of the syntax of expressions, see Section 9 âShading Language Grammar.â

5.10   Vector and Matrix Operations
       With a few exceptions, operations are component-wise. Usually, when an operator operates on a vector or
       matrix, it is operating independently on each component of the vector or matrix, in a component-wise
       fashion. For example,
           vec3 v, u;
           float f;

           v = u + f;

       will be equivalent to
           v.x = u.x + f;
           v.y = u.y + f;
           v.z = u.z + f;

       And

                                                                   5 Operators and Expressions



   vec3 v, u, w;
   w = v + u;

will be equivalent to
   w.x = v.x + u.x;
   w.y = v.y + u.y;
   w.z = v.z + u.z;

and likewise for most operators and all integer and floating point vector and matrix types. The exceptions
are matrix multiplied by vector, vector multiplied by matrix, and matrix multiplied by matrix. These do
not operate component-wise, but rather perform the correct linear algebraic multiply.
   vec3 v, u;
   mat3 m;

   u = v * m;

is equivalent to
   u.x = dot(v, m[0]); // m[0] is the left column of m
   u.y = dot(v, m[1]); // dot(a,b) is the inner (dot) product of a and b
   u.z = dot(v, m[2]);

And
   u = m * v;

is equivalent to
   u.x = m[0].x * v.x         +   m[1].x * v.y       +   m[2].x * v.z;
   u.y = m[0].y * v.x         +   m[1].y * v.y       +   m[2].y * v.z;
   u.z = m[0].z * v.x         +   m[1].z * v.y       +   m[2].z * v.z;

And
   mat3 m, n, r;

   r = m * n;

is equivalent to
   r[0].x = m[0].x * n[0].x             +   m[1].x * n[0].y   +    m[2].x * n[0].z;
   r[1].x = m[0].x * n[1].x             +   m[1].x * n[1].y   +    m[2].x * n[1].z;
   r[2].x = m[0].x * n[2].x             +   m[1].x * n[2].y   +    m[2].x * n[2].z;

   r[0].y = m[0].y * n[0].x             +   m[1].y * n[0].y   +    m[2].y * n[0].z;
   r[1].y = m[0].y * n[1].x             +   m[1].y * n[1].y   +    m[2].y * n[1].z;
   r[2].y = m[0].y * n[2].x             +   m[1].y * n[2].y   +    m[2].y * n[2].z;

   r[0].z = m[0].z * n[0].x             +   m[1].z * n[0].y   +    m[2].z * n[0].z;
   r[1].z = m[0].z * n[1].x             +   m[1].z * n[1].y   +    m[2].z * n[1].z;
   r[2].z = m[0].z * n[2].x             +   m[1].z * n[2].y   +    m[2].z * n[2].z;

and similarly for other sizes of vectors and matrices.

6 Statements and Structure

   The fundamental building blocks of the OpenGL Shading Language are:
   â¢   statements and declarations
   â¢   function definitions
   â¢   selection (if-else and switch-case-default)
   â¢   iteration (for, while, and do-while)
   â¢   jumps (discard, return, break, and continue)


   The overall structure of a shader is as follows

        translation-unit:
             global-declaration
             translation-unit global-declaration
        global-declaration:
            function-definition
            declaration
   That is, a shader is a sequence of declarations and function bodies. Function bodies are defined as

        function-definition:
             function-prototype { statement-list }
        statement-list:
             statement
             statement-list statement
        statement:
             compound-statement
             simple-statement
   Curly braces are used to group sequences of statements into compound statements.

        compound-statement:
            { statement-list }
        simple-statement:
            declaration-statement
            expression-statement
            selection-statement




                                                     53
                                                                             6 Statements and Structure



                iteration-statement
                jump-statement


      Simple declaration, expression, and jump statements end in a semi-colon.
      This above is slightly simplified, and the complete grammar specified in Section 9 âShading Language
      Grammarâ should be used as the definitive specification.
      Declarations and expressions have already been discussed.

6.1   Function Definitions
      As indicated by the grammar above, a valid shader is a sequence of global declarations and function
      definitions. A function is declared as the following example shows:
         // prototype
         returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn);

      and a function is defined like
         // definition
         returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
         {
             // do some computation
             return returnValue;
         }

      where returnType must be present and include a type. Each of the typeN must include a type and can
      optionally include a parameter qualifier and/or const.
      A function is called by using its name followed by a list of arguments in parentheses.
      Arrays are allowed as arguments and as the return type. In both cases, the array must be explicitly sized.
      An array is passed or returned by using just its name, without brackets, and the size of the array must
      match the size specified in the function's declaration.
      Structures are also allowed as argument types. The return type can also be structure.
      See Section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive reference on the syntax to declare and
      define functions.
      All functions must be either declared with a prototype or defined with a body before they are called. For
      example:
         float myfunc (float f,                    // f is an input parameter
                       out float g);               // g is an output parameter


      Functions that return no value must be declared as void. Functions that accept no input arguments need
      not use void in the argument list because prototypes (or definitions) are required and therefore there is no
      ambiguity when an empty argument list "( )" is declared. The idiom â(void)â as a parameter list is
      provided for convenience.




                                                     54
                                                                                  6 Statements and Structure



        Function names can be overloaded. The same function name can be used for multiple functions, as long
        as the parameter types differ. If a function name is declared twice with the same parameter types, then the
        return types and all qualifiers must also match, and it is the same function being declared. When function
        calls are resolved, an exact type match for all the arguments is sought. If an exact match is found, all
        other functions are ignored, and the exact match is used. If no exact match is found, then the implicit
        conversions in Section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ will be applied to find a match. Mismatched types
        on input parameters (in or inout or default) must have a conversion from the calling argument type to the
        formal parameter type. Mismatched types on output parameters (out or inout) must have a conversion
        from the formal parameter type to the calling argument type. When argument conversions are used to find
        a match, it is a semantic error if there are multiple ways to apply these conversions to make the call match
        more than one function.
        For example,
            vec4   f(in vec4 x, out vec4            y);
            vec4   f(in vec4 x, out ivec4           y); // okay, different argument type
            int    f(in vec4 x, out ivec4           y); // error, only return type differs
            vec4   f(in vec4 x, in ivec4            y); // error, only qualifier differs
            int    f(const in vec4 x, out           ivec4 y); // error, only qualifier differs

        Calling the first two functions above with the following argument types yields
            f(vec4, vec4)          //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y)
            f(vec4, ivec4)         //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out ivec4 y)
            f(ivec4, vec4)         //   error, convertible to both
            f(ivec4, ivec4)        //   okay, convertible only to vec4 f(in vec4 x, out ivec4 y)

        User-defined functions can have multiple declarations, but only one definition. A shader can redefine
        built-in functions. If a built-in function is redeclared in a shader (i.e. a prototype is visible) before a call
        to it, then the linker will only attempt to resolve that call within the set of shaders that are linked with it.
        The function main is used as the entry point to a shader executable. A shader need not contain a function
        named main, but one shader in a set of shaders linked together to form a single shader executable must.
        This function takes no arguments, returns no value, and must be declared as type void:
            void main()
            {
                ...
            }

        The function main can contain uses of return. See Section 6.4 âJumpsâ for more details.
        It is an error to declare or define a function main with any other parameters or return type.

6.1.1   Function Calling Conventions
        Functions are called by value-return. This means input arguments are copied into the function at call time,
        and output arguments are copied back to the caller before function exit. Because the function works with
        local copies of parameters, there are no issues regarding aliasing of variables within a function. To
        control what parameters are copied in and/or out through a function definition or declaration:
        â¢   The keyword in is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied in, but not copied out.




                                                         55
                                                                       6 Statements and Structure



â¢   The keyword out is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied out, but not copied in.
    This should be used whenever possible to avoid unnecessarily copying parameters in.
â¢   The keyword inout is used as a qualifier to denote the parameter is to be both copied in and copied
    out.
â¢   A function parameter declared with no such qualifier means the same thing as specifying in.
All arguments are evaluated at call time, exactly once, in order, from left to right. Evaluation of an in
parameter results in a value that is copied to the formal parameter. Evaluation of an out parameter results
in an l-value that is used to copy out a value when the function returns. Evaluation of an inout parameter
results in both a value and an l-value; the value is copied to the formal parameter at call time and the l-
value is used to copy out a value when the function returns.
The order in which output parameters are copied back to the caller is undefined.
If the function matching described in the previous section required argument type conversions, these
conversions are applied at copy-in and copy-out times.
In a function, writing to an input-only parameter is allowed. Only the functionâs copy is modified. This
can be prevented by declaring a parameter with the const qualifier.
When calling a function, expressions that do not evaluate to l-values cannot be passed to parameters
declared as out or inout.
No qualifier is allowed on the return type of a function.

     function-prototype :
          precision-qualifier type function-name(const-qualifier parameter-qualifier precision-qualifier
          type name array-specifier, ... )
     type :
          any basic type, array type, structure name, or structure definition
     const-qualifier :
          empty
          const
     parameter-qualifier :
         empty
         in
         out
         inout
     name :
         empty
         identifier
     array-specifier :
          empty
          [ integral-constant-expression ]

                                                                               6 Statements and Structure



      However, the const qualifier cannot be used with out or inout. The above is used for function
      declarations (i.e. prototypes) and for function definitions. Hence, function definitions can have unnamed
      arguments.
      Recursion is not allowed, not even statically. Static recursion is present if the static function call graph of
      the program contains cycles.

6.2   Selection
      Conditional control flow in the shading language is done by either if, if-else, or switch statements:
           selection-statement :
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement else statement
                 switch ( init-expression ) { switch-statement-listopt }
      Where switch-statement-list is a list of zero or more switch-statement and other statements defined by the
      language, where switch-statement adds some forms of labels. That is
           switch-statement-list :
                switch-statement
                switch-statement-list switch-statement
           switch-statement :
                case constant-expression :
                default :
                statement

      If an if-expression evaluates to true, then the first statement is executed. If it evaluates to false and there
      is an else part then the second statement is executed.
      Any expression whose type evaluates to a Boolean can be used as the conditional expression bool-
      expression. Vector types are not accepted as the expression to if.
      Conditionals can be nested.
      The type of init-expression in a switch statement must be a scalar integer. If a case label has a constant-
      expression of equal value, then execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, if there is a default
      label, execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, execution skips the rest of the switch statement.
      It is an error to have more than one default or a replicated constant-expression. A break statement not
      nested in a loop or other switch statement (either not nested or nested only in if or if-else statements) will
      also skip the rest of the switch statement. Fall through labels are allowed, but it is an error to have no
      statement between a label and the end of the switch statement.
      No case or default labels can be nested inside other flow control nested within their corresponding
      switch.

6.3   Iteration
      For, while, and do loops are allowed as follows:




                                                       57
                                                                             6 Statements and Structure



         for (init-expression; condition-expression; loop-expression)
             sub-statement

         while (condition-expression)
             sub-statement

         do
             statement
         while (condition-expression)

      See Section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive specification of loops.
      The for loop first evaluates the init-expression, then the condition-expression. If the condition-
      expression evaluates to true, then the body of the loop is executed. After the body is executed, a for loop
      will then evaluate the loop-expression, and then loop back to evaluate the condition-expression, repeating
      until the condition-expression evaluates to false. The loop is then exited, skipping its body and skipping
      its loop-expression. Variables modified by the loop-expression maintain their value after the loop is
      exited, provided they are still in scope. Variables declared in init-expression or condition-expression are
      only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the for loop.
      The while loop first evaluates the condition-expression. If true, then the body is executed. This is then
      repeated, until the condition-expression evaluates to false, exiting the loop and skipping its body.
      Variables declared in the condition-expression are only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the
      while loop.
      The do-while loop first executes the body, then executes the condition-expression. This is repeated until
      condition-expression evaluates to false, and then the loop is exited.
      Expressions for condition-expression must evaluate to a Boolean.
      Both the condition-expression and the init-expression can declare and initialize a variable, except in the
      do-while loop, which cannot declare a variable in its condition-expression. The variableâs scope lasts
      only until the end of the sub-statement that forms the body of the loop.
      Loops can be nested.
      Non-terminating loops are allowed. The consequences of very long or non-terminating loops are platform
      dependent.

6.4   Jumps
      These are the jumps:

           jump_statement:
               continue;
               break;
               return;
               return expression;
               discard;    // in the fragment shader language only




                                                     58
                                                                      6 Statements and Structure



There is no âgotoâ nor other non-structured flow of control.
The continue jump is used only in loops. It skips the remainder of the body of the inner most loop of
which it is inside. For while and do-while loops, this jump is to the next evaluation of the loop
condition-expression from which the loop continues as previously defined. For for loops, the jump is to
the loop-expression, followed by the condition-expression.
The break jump can also be used only in loops and switch statements. It is simply an immediate exit of
the inner-most loop or switch statements containing the break. No further execution of condition-
expression, loop-expression, or switch-statement is done.
The discard keyword is only allowed within fragment shaders. It can be used within a fragment shader to
abandon the operation on the current fragment. This keyword causes the fragment to be discarded and no
updates to any buffers will occur. Control flow exits the shader, and subsequent implicit or explicit
derivatives are undefined when this control flow is non-uniform (meaning different fragments within the
primitive take different control paths). It would typically be used within a conditional statement, for
example:
   if (intensity < 0.0)
       discard;

A fragment shader may test a fragmentâs alpha value and discard the fragment based on that test.
However, it should be noted that coverage testing occurs after the fragment shader runs, and the coverage
test can change the alpha value.
The return jump causes immediate exit of the current function. If it has expression then that is the return
value for the function.
The function main can use return. This simply causes main to exit in the same way as when the end of
the function had been reached. It does not imply a use of discard in a fragment shader. Using return in
main before defining outputs will have the same behavior as reaching the end of main before defining
outputs.

7 Built-in Variables

7.1   Vertex Shader Special Variables
      Some OpenGL operations occur in fixed functionality between the vertex processor and the fragment
      processor. Shaders communicate with the fixed functionality of OpenGL through the use of built-in
      variables.
      These built-in vertex shader variables for communicating with fixed functionality are intrinsically
      declared as follows:
         out   vec4    gl_Position;               // must be written to
         out   float   gl_PointSize;              // may be written to
         in    int     gl_VertexID;
         out   float   gl_ClipDistance[];         // may be written to
         out   vec4    gl_ClipVertex;             // may be written to, deprecated

      The variable gl_Position is available only in the vertex language and is intended for writing the
      homogeneous vertex position. All executions of a well-formed vertex shader executable must write a
      value into this variable. It can be written at any time during shader execution. It may also be read back
      by a vertex shader after being written. This value will be used by primitive assembly, clipping, culling,
      and other fixed functionality operations that operate on primitives after vertex processing has occurred.
      Compilers may generate a diagnostic message if they detect gl_Position is not written, or read before
      being written, but not all such cases are detectable. Its value is undefined if the vertex shader executable
      does not write gl_Position.
      The variable gl_PointSize is available only in the vertex language and is intended for a vertex shader to
      write the size of the point to be rasterized. It is measured in pixels.
      The variable gl_VertexID is a vertex shader an input variable that holds an integer index for the vertex, as
      defined by the OpenGL Graphics System Specification. While the variable gl_VertexID is always
      present, its value is not always defined. For details on when it is defined, see the "Shader Inputs"
      subsection of section 2.20.3 "Shader Execution" of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version
      3.0.
      The variable gl_ClipDistance provides the forward compatible mechanism in the vertex shader for
      controlling user clipping. To use this, a vertex shader is responsible for maintaining a set of clip planes,
      computing the distance from the vertex to each clip plane, and storing distances to the plane in
      gl_ClipDistance[i] for each plane i. A distance of 0 means the vertex is on the plane, a positive distance
      means the vertex is inside the clip plane, and a negative distance means the point is outside the clip plane.
      The clip distances will be linearly interpolated across the primitive and the portion of the primitive with
      interpolated distances less than 0 will be clipped.




                                                     60
                                                                                             7 Built-in Variables



      The gl_ClipDistance array is predeclared as unsized and must be sized by the shader either redeclaring it
      with a size or indexing it only with integral constant expressions. This needs to size the array to include
      all the clip planes that are enabled via the OpenGL API; if the size does not include all enabled planes,
      results are undefined. The size can be at most gl_MaxClipDistances. The number of varying components
      (see gl_MaxVaryingComponents) consumed by gl_ClipDistance will match the size of the array, no
      matter how many planes are enabled. The shader must also set all values in gl_ClipDistance that have
      been enabled via the OpenGL API, or results are undefined. Values written into gl_ClipDistance for
      planes that are not enabled have no effect.
      The variable gl_ClipVertex is deprecated. It is available only in the vertex language and provides a place
      for vertex shaders to write the coordinate to be used with the user clipping planes. The user must ensure
      the clip vertex and user clipping planes are defined in the same coordinate space. User clip planes work
      properly only under linear transform. It is undefined what happens under non-linear transform.
      If a linked set of shaders forming the vertex stage contains no static write to gl_ClipVertex or
      gl_ClipDistance, but the application has requested clipping against user clip planes through the API, then
      the coordinate written to gl_Position is used for comparison against the user clip planes. This behavior is
      also deprecated. Writing to gl_ClipDistance is the preferred method for user clipping. It is an error for a
      shader to statically write both gl_ClipVertex and gl_ClipDistance.
      If gl_PointSize is not written to, its value is undefined in subsequent pipe stages.

7.2   Fragment Shader Special Variables
      The built-in special variables that are accessible from a fragment shader are intrinsically declared as
      follows:
         in    vec4    gl_FragCoord;
         in    bool    gl_FrontFacing;
         in    float   gl_ClipDistance[];
         out   vec4    gl_FragColor;                                 // deprecated
         out   vec4    gl_FragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers];               // deprecated
         out   float   gl_FragDepth;

      Except as noted below, they behave as other input and output variables.
      The output of the fragment shader executable is processed by the fixed function operations at the back end
      of the OpenGL pipeline.
      Fragment shaders output values to the OpenGL pipeline using the built-in variables gl_FragColor,
      gl_FragData, and gl_FragDepth, unless the discard statement is executed. Both gl_FragColor and
      gl_FragData are deprecated; the preferred usage is to explicitly declare these outputs in the fragment
      shader using the out storage qualifier.
      The fixed functionality computed depth for a fragment may be obtained by reading gl_FragCoord.z,
      described below.
      Deprecated: Writing to gl_FragColor specifies the fragment color that will be used by the subsequent
      fixed functionality pipeline. If subsequent fixed functionality consumes fragment color and an execution
      of the fragment shader executable does not write a value to gl_FragColor then the fragment color
      consumed is undefined.




                                                     61
                                                                                            7 Built-in Variables



      If the frame buffer is configured as a color index buffer then behavior is undefined when using a fragment
      shader.
      Writing to gl_FragDepth will establish the depth value for the fragment being processed. If depth
      buffering is enabled, and no shader writes gl_FragDepth, then the fixed function value for depth will be
      used as the fragmentâs depth value. If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragDepth, and there is an
      execution path through the shader that does not set gl_FragDepth, then the value of the fragmentâs depth
      may be undefined for executions of the shader that take that path. That is, if the set of linked fragment
      shaders statically contain a write to gl_FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.
      Deprecated: The variable gl_FragData is an array. Writing to gl_FragData[n] specifies the fragment
      data that will be used by the subsequent fixed functionality pipeline for data n. If subsequent fixed
      functionality consumes fragment data and an execution of a fragment shader executable does not write a
      value to it, then the fragment data consumed is undefined.
      If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragColor, it may not assign a value to any element of
      gl_FragData. If a shader statically writes a value to any element of gl_FragData, it may not assign a
      value to gl_FragColor. That is, a shader may assign values to either gl_FragColor or gl_FragData, but
      not both. Multiple shaders linked together must also consistently write just one of these variables.
      Similarly, if user declared output variables are in use (statically assigned to), then the built-in variables
      gl_FragColor and gl_FragData may not be assigned to. These incorrect usages all generate compile time
      errors.
      If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and the values of any user-defined
      fragment outputs, gl_FragDepth, gl_FragColor, and gl_FragData become irrelevant.
      The variable gl_FragCoord is available as an input variable from within fragment shaders and it holds the
      window relative coordinates x, y, z, and 1/w values for the fragment. If multi-sampling, this value can be
      for any location within the pixel, or one of the fragment samples. The use of centroid in does not further
      restrict this value to be inside the current primitive. This value is the result of the fixed functionality that
      interpolates primitives after vertex processing to generate fragments. The z component is the depth value
      that would be used for the fragmentâs depth if no shader contained any writes to gl_FragDepth. This is
      useful for invariance if a shader conditionally computes gl_FragDepth but otherwise wants the fixed
      functionality fragment depth.
      Fragment shaders have access to the input built-in variable gl_FrontFacing, whose value is true if the
      fragment belongs to a front-facing primitive. One use of this is to emulate two-sided lighting by selecting
      one of two colors calculated by a vertex shader.
      The built-in input variable gl_ClipDistance array contains linearly interpolated values for the vertex
      values written by the vertex shader to the gl_ClipDistance vertex output variable. This array must be
      sized in the fragment shader either implicitly or explicitly to be the same size as it was sized in the vertex
      shader. Only elements in this array that have clipping enabled will have defined values.

7.3   Vertex Shader Built-In Inputs
      Deprecated: The following predeclared input names can be used from within a vertex shader to access the
      current values of OpenGL state.

7.4   Built-In Constants
      The following built-in constants are provided to vertex and fragment shaders. The actual values used are
      implementation dependent, but must be at least the value shown. Some are deprecated, as indicated in
      comments.
         //
         // Implementation dependent constants. The example values below
         // are the minimum values allowed for these maximums.

         const int gl_MaxTextureCoords = 8;                              // deprecated


      The constant gl_MaxVaryingFloats is deprecated, use gl_MaxVaryingComponents instead. The constant
      gl_MaxClipPlanes is deprecated along with user clip planes, use clip distances and gl_MaxClipDistances
      instead. The constant gl_MaxTextureCoords is deprecated, use user-defined interpolants instead.

7.6   Built-In Vertex Output and Fragment Input Variables
      Unlike user-defined interpolated variables, the mapping between the built-in vertex output variables to the
      built-in fragment input variables doesn't have a strict one-to-one correspondence. Two sets are provided,
      one for each language. Their relationship is described below.
      It is deprecated to have the GL provide fixed functionality behavior for a programmable pipeline stage.
      For example, mixing a fixed functionality vertex stage with a programmable fragment stage is deprecated.
      Pipeline configurations where only a proper subset of stages are being used do not require the unused
      stages to have shaders.
      The following built-in vertex output variables are available, but deprecated. A particular one should be
      written to if any functionality in a corresponding fragment shader or fixed pipeline uses it or state derived
      from it. Otherwise, behavior is undefined.




                                                      67
                                                                                     7 Built-in Variables



   out   vec4     gl_FrontColor;                     //   deprecated
   out   vec4     gl_BackColor;                      //   deprecated
   out   vec4     gl_FrontSecondaryColor;            //   deprecated
   out   vec4     gl_BackSecondaryColor;             //   deprecated

   out vec4 gl_TexCoord[]; // deprecated, at most will be gl_MaxTextureCoords
   out float gl_FogFragCoord;// deprecated

For gl_FogFragCoord (deprecated), the value written will be used as the âcâ value in section 3.11 of the
OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0, by the fixed functionality pipeline. For example, if
the z-coordinate of the fragment in eye space is desired as âcâ, then that's what the vertex shader
executable should write into gl_FogFragCoord.
As with all arrays, indices used to subscript gl_TexCoord (deprecated) must either be an integral constant
expressions, or this array must be re-declared by the shader with a size. The size can be at most
gl_MaxTextureCoords. Using indexes close to 0 may aid the implementation in preserving varying
resources.
The following fragment input variables are available in a fragment shader.
   in vec2      gl_PointCoord;

The following fragment inputs are also available in a fragment shader, but are deprecated:
   in   float   gl_FogFragCoord;               //    deprecated
   in   vec4    gl_TexCoord[];                 //    deprecated
   in   vec4    gl_Color;                      //    deprecated
   in   vec4    gl_SecondaryColor;             //    deprecated

Deprecated: The values in gl_Color and gl_SecondaryColor will be derived automatically by the system
from gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor, gl_FrontSecondaryColor, and gl_BackSecondaryColor based on
which face is visible. If fixed functionality is used for vertex processing, then gl_FogFragCoord will
either be the z-coordinate of the fragment in eye space, or the interpolation of the fog coordinate, as
described in section 3.11 of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0. The
gl_TexCoord[] values are the interpolated gl_TexCoord[] values from a vertex shader or the texture
coordinates of any fixed pipeline based vertex functionality.
Indices to the fragment shader gl_TexCoord array are as described above in the vertex shader text.
The values in gl_PointCoord are two-dimensional coordinates indicating where within a point primitive
the current fragment is located, when point sprites are enabled. They range from 0.0 to 1.0 across the
point. If the current primitive is not a point, or if point sprites are not enabled, then the values read from
gl_PointCoord are undefined.

8 Built-in Functions

   The OpenGL Shading Language defines an assortment of built-in convenience functions for scalar and
   vector operations. Many of these built-in functions can be used in more than one type of shader, but some
   are intended to provide a direct mapping to hardware and so are available only for a specific type of
   shader.
   The built-in functions basically fall into three categories:
   â¢   They expose some necessary hardware functionality in a convenient way such as accessing a texture
       map. There is no way in the language for these functions to be emulated by a shader.
   â¢   They represent a trivial operation (clamp, mix, etc.) that is very simple for the user to write, but they
       are very common and may have direct hardware support. It is a very hard problem for the compiler to
       map expressions to complex assembler instructions.
   â¢   They represent an operation graphics hardware is likely to accelerate at some point. The trigonometry
       functions fall into this category.
   Many of the functions are similar to the same named ones in common C libraries, but they support vector
   input as well as the more traditional scalar input.
   Applications should be encouraged to use the built-in functions rather than do the equivalent computations
   in their own shader code since the built-in functions are assumed to be optimal (e.g., perhaps supported
   directly in hardware).
   User code can replace built-in functions with their own if they choose, by simply re-declaring and defining
   the same name and argument list. Because built-in functions are in a more outer scope than user built-in
   functions, doing this will hide all built-in functions with the same name as the re-declared function.
   When the built-in functions are specified below, where the input arguments (and corresponding output)
   can be float, vec2, vec3, or vec4, genType is used as the argument. Where the input arguments (and
   corresponding output) can be int, ivec2, ivec3, or ivec4, genIType is used as the argument. Where the
   input arguments (and corresponding output) can be uint, uvec2, uvec3, or uvec4, genUType is used as the
   argument. For any specific use of a function, the actual type substituted for genType, genIType, or
   genUType has to be the same for all arguments and for the return type. Similarly for mat, which can be
   any matrix basic type.

8.1   Angle and Trigonometry Functions
      Function parameters specified as angle are assumed to be in units of radians. In no case will any of these
      functions result in a divide by zero error. If the divisor of a ratio is 0, then results will be undefined.
      These all operate component-wise. The description is per component.

                                                    This includes the possibility that round(x) returns the
                                                    same value as roundEven(x) for all values of x.

                                                    fractional part of 0.5 will round toward the nearest even
                                                    integer. (Both 3.5 and 4.5 for x will return 4.0.)

       genType ceil (genType x)                     Returns a value equal to the nearest integer that is

8.7   Texture Lookup Functions
      Texture lookup functions are available to both vertex and fragment shaders. However, level of detail is
      not implicitly computed for vertex shaders. The functions in the table below provide access to textures
      through samplers, as set up through the OpenGL API. Texture properties such as size, pixel format,
      number of dimensions, filtering method, number of mip-map levels, depth comparison, and so on are also
      defined by OpenGL API calls. Such properties are taken into account as the texture is accessed via the
      built-in functions defined below.
      Texture data can be stored by the GL as floating point, unsigned normalized integer, unsigned integer or
      signed integer data. This is determined by the type of the internal format of the texture. Texture lookups
      on unsigned normalized integer and floating point data return floating point values in the range [0, 1].
      Texture lookup functions are provided that can return their result as floating point, unsigned integer or
      signed integer, depending on the sampler type passed to the lookup function. Care must be taken to use
      the right sampler type for texture access. The following table lists the supported combinations of sampler
      types and texture internal formats. Blank entries are unsupported. Doing a texture lookup will return
      undefined values for unsupported combinations.

            Floating point                  Supported
            Normalized Integer              Supported
            Signed Integer                                       Supported
            Unsigned Integer                                                         Supported


      If an integer sampler type is used, the result of a texture lookup is an ivec4. If an unsigned integer sampler
      type is used, the result of a texture lookup is a uvec4. If a floating point sampler type is used, the result of
      a texture lookup is a vec4, where each component is in the range [0, 1].
      In the prototypes below, the âgâ in the return type âgvec4â is used as a placeholder for nothing, âiâ, or âuâ
      making a return type of vec4, ivec4, or uvec4. In these cases, the sampler argument type also starts with
      âgâ, indicating the same substitution done on the return type; it is either a floating point, signed integer, or
      unsigned integer sampler, matching the basic type of the return type, as described above.
      For shadow forms (the sampler parameter is a shadow-type), a depth comparison lookup on the depth
      texture bound to sampler is done as described in section 3.9.14 of the OpenGL Graphics System
      Specification, Version 3.0. See the table below for which component specifies Dref. The texture bound to
      sampler must be a depth texture, or results are undefined. If a non-shadow texture call is made to a
      sampler that represents a depth texture with depth comparisons turned on, then results are undefined. If a
      shadow texture call is made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth comparisons turned
      off, then results are undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that does not represent a
      depth texture, then results are undefined.

In all functions below, the bias parameter is optional for fragment shaders. The bias parameter is not
accepted in a vertex shader. For a fragment shader, if bias is present, it is added to the implicit level of
detail prior to performing the texture access operation.
The implicit level of detail is selected as follows: For a texture that is not mip-mapped, the texture is used
directly. If it is mip-mapped and running in a fragment shader, the LOD computed by the implementation
is used to do the texture lookup. If it is mip-mapped and running on the vertex shader, then the base
texture is used.
Some texture functions (non-âLodâ and non-âGradâ versions) may require implicit derivatives. Implicit
derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow and for vertex shader texture fetches.
For Cube forms, the direction of P is used to select which face to do a 2-dimensional texture lookup in, as
described in section 3.9.6 in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0.
For Array forms, the array layer used will be
  max î0,min îd â1, floorîlayerî0.5îîî
where d is the depth of the texture array and layer comes from the component indicated in the tables
below.

8.8   Fragment Processing Functions
      Fragment processing functions are only available in fragment shaders.
      Derivatives may be computationally expensive and/or numerically unstable. Therefore, an OpenGL
      implementation may approximate the true derivatives by using a fast but not entirely accurate derivative
      computation. Derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow.
      The expected behavior of a derivative is specified using forward/backward differencing.
      Forward differencing:
          F î xîdxîâF î xî ~ dFdxî xîâdx          1a
                       F î xîdxîâF î xî
          dFdxî xî ~                              1b
                              dx


      Backward differencing:
          F î xâdxîâF î xî ~âdFdxî xîâdx          2a
                       F î xîâF îxâdxî
          dFdxî xî ~                              2b
                              dx


      With single-sample rasterization, dx <= 1.0 in equations 1b and 2b. For multi-sample rasterization, dx <
      2.0 in equations 1b and 2b.
      dFdy is approximated similarly, with y replacing x.




                                                    89
                                                                                   8 Built-in Functions



A GL implementation may use the above or other methods to perform the calculation, subject to the
following conditions:
1. The method may use piecewise linear approximations. Such linear approximations imply that higher
   order derivatives, dFdx(dFdx(x)) and above, are undefined.
2. The method may assume that the function evaluated is continuous. Therefore derivatives within the
   body of a non-uniform conditional are undefined.
3. The method may differ per fragment, subject to the constraint that the method may vary by window
   coordinates, not screen coordinates. The invariance requirement described in section 3.2 of the
   OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0, is relaxed for derivative calculations, because
   the method may be a function of fragment location.
Other properties that are desirable, but not required, are:
4. Functions should be evaluated within the interior of a primitive (interpolated, not extrapolated).
5. Functions for dFdx should be evaluated while holding y constant. Functions for dFdy should be
   evaluated while holding x constant. However, mixed higher order derivatives, like dFdx(dFdy(y))
   and dFdy(dFdx(x)) are undefined.
6. Derivatives of constant arguments should be 0.
In some implementations, varying degrees of derivative accuracy may be obtained by providing GL hints
(section 5.6 of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, Version 3.0), allowing a user to make an
image quality versus speed trade off.


 Syntax                                            Description
 genType dFdx (genType p)                         Returns the derivative in x using local differencing for
                                                  the input argument p.


 genType dFdy (genType p)                         Returns the derivative in y using local differencing for
                                                  the input argument p.

                                                  These two functions are commonly used to estimate the
                                                  filter width used to anti-alias procedural textures. We
                                                  are assuming that the expression is being evaluated in
                                                  parallel on a SIMD array so that at any given point in
                                                  time the value of the function is known at the grid points
                                                  represented by the SIMD array. Local differencing
                                                  between SIMD array elements can therefore be used to
                                                  derive dFdx, dFdy, etc.

 genType fwidth (genType p)                       Returns the sum of the absolute derivative in x and y
                                                  using local differencing for the input argument p, i.e.:
                                                  abs (dFdx (p)) + abs (dFdy (p));

8.9   Noise Functions
      Noise functions are available to both fragment and vertex shaders. They are stochastic functions that can
      be used to increase visual complexity. Values returned by the following noise functions give the
      appearance of randomness, but are not truly random. The noise functions below are defined to have the
      following characteristics:
      â¢     The return value(s) are always in the range [-1.0,1.0], and cover at least the range [-0.6, 0.6], with a
            Gaussian-like distribution.
      â¢     The return value(s) have an overall average of 0.0
      â¢     They are repeatable, in that a particular input value will always produce the same return value
      â¢     They are statistically invariant under rotation (i.e., no matter how the domain is rotated, it has the same
            statistical character)
      â¢     They have a statistical invariance under translation (i.e., no matter how the domain is translated, it has
            the same statistical character)
      â¢     They typically give different results under translation.
      â¢     The spatial frequency is narrowly concentrated, centered somewhere between 0.5 to 1.0.
      â¢     They are C1 continuous everywhere (i.e., the first derivative is continuous)


          Syntax                                           Description
          float noise1 (genType x)                         Returns a 1D noise value based on the input value x.


          vec2 noise2 (genType x)                          Returns a 2D noise value based on the input value x.


          vec3 noise3 (genType x)                          Returns a 3D noise value based on the input value x.


          vec4 noise4 (genType x)                          Returns a 4D noise value based on the input value x.

2. How do we do flat shading?
   Alternate Resolution: Add flat qualifier for varyings.
   Alternate Resolution: Add flat qualifier for varyings that obeys shade mode.
   Resolution: Add flat, but restrict it to gl_*color varyings with the same semantics as flat in 2.x. In the API, there
   is immutable state in the program object that sets the default. Also add smooth to the language for overriding
   when the default is flat.
3. What is the complete list of fundamental data types transparently exchangeable?
   Alternate Resolution: Just floating point types.
   Resolution: float, int, and bool.
4. Are there any cache flushing issues around writing to bound partitions? -> See issue 9.
5. Complex matrix -> matrix constructors.
   Resolution: Defer.
6. How do we do two-sided coloring? This interacts with clamping, because fixed hardware dealing with this would
also clamp.
   No language impact.
   Resolution: A two-sided enable goes into program object as immutable state. It is not a link error if one-sided is
   enabled and back-color is written. All other mis-matches are just undefined.
7. Do we do clamping? How is this determined?
   No language impact.
   Resolution: Have immutable state in the program object that says whether color input to the rasterizer is
   clamped. Add another for fragment output.
9. What about cache flushing common blocks? Is it bound during writes? Do we expect all shader hardware to
have to write to the same resource shaders read common blocks from?
   We might expect separate resources. But, this is part of a much bigger problem that needs to be resolved in the
   API.
   Alternative 1: Implementations use API calls like draw to be responsible for implicitly refreshing the resource.
   Alternative 2: Add an explicit call to say you are done changing it.
   Resolution: See API spec. resolution.
10. Problem with built-in texture function names, how do we reduce?
   - we will at least drop the texture type from the function name




                                                         104
                                                                                                           10 Issues



   - consider using named parameters
   - consider using programs to specify the lookup
11. Do we want application named fragment-shader outputs.
   Resolution: Yes.
12. Should we switch to application-assigned slots for the varying linkage between vertex and fragment shaders?
   Alternate Resolution: No. Keep doing it the way 2.x does it.
   Resolution: This is an API issue. See API spec.
13. Can we query declared varyings?
   Resolution: Yes. This is an API issue. See API spec.
14. Are there any sRGB impacts to the language?
   Resolution: No. The shader pipe assumes linear space. sRGB is in filtering state going into the shader and in
   output space after leaving the shader.
15. How do you declare a flat varying? We said the only variables that can be flat are "gl_*color", but those are
already declared.
   Resolution: Just like invariant, allow a built-in variable to be redeclared as long as the redeclaration just
   adds/changes the qualifiers. Note we also allow redeclarations to give an array explicit size.
   -> don't allow bad redeclarations of built-ins
16. Should allow variations in the value of a flat varying across a triangle? (For the case where real interpolators are
still used and might not get exactly the same result for each pixel.)
   Resolution: No. The value is invariant across the triangle.
17. Do precision qualifiers have to match? If the intention is to aid porting, not really save space/power, it is
actually more helpful if they don't have to match like they do in the ES spec.
   Alternate Resolution: No. Allow precision mismatches. This would imply all precisions are interchangeable,
   hence we could formalize that and just say the language recognizes the keywords, but they don't have any
   meaning. This means the specification is very simple and easy to understand.
   -> get the most recent ES spec to see what it does.
   Resolution: precision qualifiers have no semantics.
18. Does an application running on mixed hardware have the same layout for a common block for all shaders the
common block is in? Different contexts can be for different adapters.
   Resolution: Offsets could be different on different hardware. But, if they are successfully created, then the
   offsets will match, and common blocks can be shared. Future could consider things like âpacked commonâ or
   âvec4 commonâ ...
19. Do we support initializers inside of common blocks? How does the API handle them? We already chose the
language syntax that makes it easy to provide.
   Resolution: Yes. Face-to-face strawpoll: for 9, against 3, abstain 5.

                                                                                                          10 Issues



21. Does flat/smooth/default have to match across stages?
   Alternate Resolution A. No. Exclude flat/smooth from other stage's languages, and say it's really a fragment
   shader control. Problem is that depends on implementation and where the interpolation happens.
   Alternate Resolution B. It is interfaces whose sides have to match, not shaders. The output of one stage has to
   match the input of the next stage. The input to a stage does not have to match the output of that stage. Semantics
   have been, but can be more clearly stated as: the variable the shader is manipulating was copied in from the input
   interface at the beginning and copied out to the output interface at the end.
   Alternate Resolution C. Build on B, take inout and in and out into account, with it's benefit of allowing reuse of
   names. That means allowing both âin colorâ and âout colorâ in the same shader to mean the same thing as âinout
   colorâ. Then, they can be decorated differently âin colorâ and âout flat colorâ without contradiction because the
   decorations are modifying the interface, not the variable the shader is manipulating. Note that even without this
   issue we need to say what happens with either âinout colorâ or âin color; out colorâ. See issue 24.
   Resolution: Interfaces match. Inputs and outputs within a shader do not have to match.
22. Does invariant still have to match across stages?
   Resolution: Yes.
23. Do we want to get rid of gl_DepthRange? Getting rid of it only really makes sense if it's the only remaining
state that has to be tracked.
   Resolution: No, keep it.
24. If a shader declares âinout colorâ and then does not use the variable color (but the previous and/or following
stage did use color), what happens?
   Alternate Resolution. There is an implicit copy from the input color to the output color. Note this is a corollary
   anyway of the idea that input variables are copied in at start of shader and copied out to the output at the end of
   the shader. Note the interaction with this and basing set of varyings off of declarations vs. static or active use.
   Resolution: Remove inout. This also fixes interpolation qualifier ambiguities.
25. What API mechanism do we use to do #include.
   Alternate Resolution A: Simple database of names mapped to include strings on the server in the context.
   Shader has includes that use those names, and compile time does string substitutions from the simple database.
   Alternate Resolution B: Rob's proposal. Similar to A, but strings are stored as âtext objectsâ. More
   differences... see Rob's email.
   Alternative Resolution C: Pass in each time a mapping of names to strings that's used by that compile.
   Alternative Resolution D:
   Alternative Resolution E: No #include.
   Alternative Resolution F: Re-use shader objects: give them names, include by name. Requires changing the
   semantics of shader object to not parse shaders that have a name. Shaders that are the roots of compile cannot
   have names.
   Resolution: This is handled by the API spec., through new objects for storing text strings.
26. Do we want to restrict switch to something simpler than C?




                                                         106
                                                                                                            10 Issues



   Resolution: Yes. No case inside flow control.
27. Can precision qualifiers be specified to do nothing instead of ES functionality?
   Resolution: leave ES-like functionality to extensions.
30. Are diagnostics for included files identifying locations as a triple (name string, string number, line number) or a
pair (name string, line number). The implication being that the API sets the included text either as an array of strings
or a single string. What does __FILE__ return
   Resolution: As a pair. __FILE__ can return a string or a number, depending on the context.
32. Are we allowing bool/int in common blocks now, just like we do for the default partition?
   Resolution: Yes, put bool/int back into common blocks.
35. Do we want to say âcentroid inâ or âin centroidâ, and similarly for smooth and flat? May have implications to
expressing aliasing of varying with longer chains of qualifiers.
   Resolution: âcentroid inâ
36. What packing rules go in the language spec.?
   Resolution: It depends on whether future mechanisms for influencing packing are in the API or in the language.
   For now, the language spec. will specify the packing rules if a common block contains nothing but vec4s.
37. Are we removing user clip planes? Need to remove gl_ClipVertex.
   Resolution: No. For 1.30, keep gl_ClipVertex with it's previous semantics. If gl_ClipVertex is not statically
   written, then gl_Position is used instead for clipping against user planes if they've been enabled. Also, add
   gl_ClipDistance.
38. Do we need to add any guarantees of precision of pass through data? Like 16 bits of color?
   Resolution: Deferred.
39. int(uint) and uint(int) are not conversions, they are reinterprets. This is a poor consistency in the language.
   Resolution: These are constructors, not type casts, which can do what they want. In this case they reinterpret,
   even though in other cases they convert.
40. How should the number of clip distances be set? How does this relate to API side enables? How does it relate to
sizing the gl_ClipDistance array in the language?
   Resolution: Use enables.
41. Do we need to specify the precision of integer division?
42. Is the API adding support for #include? If not, remove from language.
   Resolution: Remove.
43. Some gl_VertexID description seems like it does not belong in the language spec.
  Done.
44. What needs to be said about transform feedback of built-in vertex outputs?
   Resolution: Nothing.

45. Still need to finish some ES synchronization (a set of pretty small details).
46. Lacking a partition scheme that's memory efficient for the case of lots of inactive uniforms declared in a common
block (partition).
   Resolution: This is unnecessary. Having just the default partition (non-common globals) support this space
   optimization is sufficient, as it is not for sharing between programs and offsets always have to be queried.
47. Need more clarity on the effects of uint vs int. It appears to allow binary operations between an int and a uint,
but doesn't really say what happens.
   Resolution: No implicit conversions; some operators are defined to take mixed operands, most are not.
48. List deprecated features in one place.
   Resolution. Yes.
49. Should the token-pasting language say that that results of the token pasting are then further processed by the
preprocessor?
   Resolution: Yes.
50. flat, noperspective, centroid, smooth axes, combinations, etc. Is there an issue here?
51. broader support for mixing signed and unsigned in an expression
   dup. of 47
52. deprecating gl_FragColor deprecates broadcast. Is that okay?
   Resolution: Yes.
53. What does "Not having shaders for programming all programmable stages..." mean to commands like
DrawPixels that today run a fragment shader without a vertex shader. Do you have to make up a dummy vertex
shader? Of course, with fixed-function vertex attributes (and thus RasterPos attributes) gone, it seems like
DrawPixels (and Bitmap) as we know and love (?) it today would have to go. Not having seen a list of deprecated
features for OpenGL 3.0, I have no idea if it's already on the list.
   Resolution: All programmable stages that are being used must have shaders provided for those stages. (Don't
   mention programs.)
54. Should we remove row_major from the language.
   Resolution: Yes.
55. Should we add gl_ClipDistance as input to the fragment shader.
   Resolution: Yes.
56. Don't say 1.2 and 1.1 are not accepted.
   Resolution: Yes, accept 1.1 and 1.2.
57. Do we have user-defined flat variables?
   Resolution: Yes. Fix spec. inconsistency. Only way to have integer varyings.
58. Should we really remove functionality instead of deprecate it?

   Resolution: Deprecate before remove. Read API spec. appendix.
59. Can a global out redeclare the same name as a global in?
   Resolution: No.
