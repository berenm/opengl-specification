1 Introduction

   This document specifies only version 4.40 of the OpenGL Shading Language. It requires __VERSION__
   to substitute 440, and requires #version to accept only 440. If #version is declared with a smaller
   number, the language accepted is a previous version of the shading language, which will be supported
   depending on the version and type of context in the OpenGL API. See the OpenGL Graphics System
   Specification, Version 4.4, for details on what language versions are supported.
   Previous versions of the OpenGL Shading Language, as well as the OpenGL ES Shading Language, are
   not strict subsets of the version specified here, particularly with respect to precision, name-hiding rules,
   and treatment of interface variables. See the specification corresponding to a particular language version
   for details specific to that version of the language.
   All OpenGL Graphics System Specification references in this specification are to version 4.4.

1.2     Changes
1.2.1   Changes since revision 7 of GLSL version 4.40
           â¢   Bug 10440: Clarify that a name collision between members of two anonymous blocks, or
               between a variable and a member of an anonymous block is an error.
           â¢   Bug 11009: Removed packed from the reserved word list.
           â¢   Bug 11299: Fixed textureOffset for sampler2DArrayShadow to take a ivec2 (not a vec2) for
               the offset.
           â¢   Bug 11209: It is a compile-time error to use the same block name for more than one block
               declaration in the same interface within one shader, even if the block contents are identical.
           â¢   Bug 11100: Simplify statement of what is written by EmitStreamVertex() to just say all built-in
               and user-defined output variables.
           â¢   Bug 11096: gl_SampleMask can be sized to be no larger than the implementation-dependent
               maximum sample-mask.
           â¢   Bug 10812: Missing text: Added the phrase âa pair of 16-bit signed integersâ when describing
               unpackSnorm2x16.
           â¢   Bug 10804: When a uniform layout location is used, it is not required that all declarations of that
               name include the location; only that those that include a location use the same location.
           â¢   Bug 11001: Remove extraneous âgâ from some gsampler..shadow types.
           â¢   Bug 10990: Remove old contradictory text requiring interpolation qualifiers to match cross
               stage; they must only match within a stage.
           â¢   Bug 9999: Editorial: add explanatory text about optimizing in section 4.4.2.4 about fragment
               output layout qualifiers: âThis potentially includes skipping shader execution if the fragment is
               discarded because it is occluded and the shader has no side effects.â
           â¢   Bug 10485: It is only geometry shaders whose input is sized by the input primitive layout
               declaration.
           â¢   Bug 10903. Clarify that members of structures cannot be declared as atomic counter types.
           â¢   Put missing storage qualifiers in component examples.
           â¢   Bug 11457. Add missing âSHAREDâ to the layout_qualifier_id grammar in section 9. This was
               already correctly reflected in the body of the specification.
           â¢   Bug 11392. Clarify that comments do eliminate new lines (but don't change the line count) and
               that the preprocessing character set is bigger than the character set used in the resulting stream of
               GLSL tokens.
           â¢   Bug 7343. Clarify interactions between comments, new lines, and preprocessing by explicitly
               listing the logical phases of compilation.

                                                                                                  1 Introduction



            â¢   Bug 11362: When counting locations consumed, clarify that the outer array level for geometry
                shader inputs, tessellation control shader inputs and outputs, and tessellation evaluation inputs is
                first removed before counting.
            â¢   Bug 10737: State more clearly which types are illegal for inputs and outputs.
            â¢   Bug 11178: Correct function overloading examples, which were from a different revision of the
                spec. than the current rules.
            â¢   Bug 10593: Clarify that within a declaration, if inout is used, neither in nor out may be used,
                and none of these can be repeated.
            â¢   Bug 11052: Make type matching across compilation units in the same program apply to all
                declared variables (not just those statically used, etc.)
            â¢   Bug 10941: When accessing the same packed buffer across multiple stages in the same program,
                it either works or you get a link error.

1.2.2   Changes since revision 6 of GLSL version 4.40
        Deprecation
            â¢   Bug 384: Noise is now
                â¦     defined to return 0, and
                â¦     deprecated (not removed).
        Changes
            â¢   Bug 10628: Subroutine arrays now require the index to be dynamically uniform.
            â¢   Bug 10440: Refine the link-time error: Within an interface, all declarations of the same global
                name must be for the same object and must match in type and in whether they declare a variable
                or member of a block with no instance name.
            â¢   Bug 10713: Update the offset/align example in section 4.4.5 to adhere to the std140 alignment
                requirements.
            â¢   A few other examples corrected.
            â¢   Changed
                â¦     gl_MaxComputeAtomicCounterBuffers to 8, and
                â¦     gl_MaxCombinedTextureImageUnits to 96.
        Clarifications
            â¢   Bug 10655: Clarification that opaque types (e.g., samplers) can be in a uniform (e.g., member in
                a struct), not just a non-aggregate uniform variable.
            â¢   Bug 10659: Be even more clear that blocks generally cannot be redeclared as a way to size an
                unsized array contained in the block.
            â¢   Bug 10735: Clarify that sampler type declarations can have precision qualifiers.




                                                       4
                                                                                                   1 Introduction



            â¢   Bug 10682: Clarify that built-in functions with void return or out arguments are not included in
                in the set of constant expressions.

1.2.3   Summary of Changes from Revision 9 of GLSL Version 4.30
        Deprecations
            â¢   The built-in noise*() functions are deprecated. They are not removed, but are defined to return
                0.
        Changes
            â¢   Incorporate the ARB_enhanced_layouts extension, which adds
                â¦   compile-time constant expressions for layout qualifier integers
                â¦   new offset and align layout qualifiers for control over buffer block layouts
                â¦   add location layout qualifier for input and output blocks and block members
                â¦   new component layout qualifier for finer-grained layout control of input and output
                    variables and blocks
                â¦   new xfb_buffer, xfb_stride, and xfb_offset layout qualifiers to allow the shader to control
                    transform feedback buffering.
            â¢   Bug 10530: To be consistent with ES, include sample types as valid in a precision statement.
                Note the defaults are irrelevant, as precision qualifiers are not required or have any meaning.
            â¢   Bug 10628: Subroutine arrays now require the index to be dynamically uniform.

1.3   Overview
      This document describes The OpenGL Shading Language, version 4.40.
      Independent compilation units written in this language are called shaders. A program is a set of shaders
      that are compiled and linked together, completely creating one or more of the programmable stages of the
      OpenGL pipeline. All the shaders for a single programmable stage must be within the same program. A
      complete set of programmable stages can be put into a single program or the stages can be partitioned
      across multiple programs. The aim of this document is to thoroughly specify the programming language.
      The OpenGL Graphics System Specification will specify the OpenGL entry points used to manipulate and
      communicate with programs and shaders.

1.4   Error Handling
      Compilers, in general, accept programs that are ill-formed, due to the impossibility of detecting all ill-
      formed programs. Portability is only ensured for well-formed programs, which this specification
      describes. Compilers are encouraged to detect ill-formed programs and issue diagnostic messages, but are
      not required to do so for all cases. Compile-time errors must be returned for lexically or grammatically
      incorrect shaders. Other errors are reported at compile time or link time as indicated. Code that is âdeadâ
      must still be error checked. For example:
         if (false)     // changing false to true cannot uncover additional errors
             statement; // statement must be error checked regardless



1.5   Typographical Conventions
      Italic, bold, and font choices have been used in this specification primarily to improve readability. Code
      fragments use a fixed width font. Identifiers embedded in text are italicized. Keywords embedded in text
      are bold. Operators are called by their name, followed by their symbol in bold in parentheses. The
      clarifying grammar fragments in the text use bold for literals and italics for non-terminals. The official
      grammar in section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ uses all capitals for terminals and lower case for
      non-terminals.

1.6   Deprecation
      The OpenGL Shading Language has deprecated some features. These are clearly called out in this
      specification as âdeprecatedâ. They are still present in this version of the language, but are targeted for
      potential removal in a future version of the shading language. The OpenGL API has a forward
      compatibility mode that will disallow use of deprecated features. If compiling in a mode where use of
      deprecated features is disallowed, their use causes compile-time or link-time errors. See the OpenGL

2 Overview of OpenGL Shading

      The OpenGL Shading Language is actually several closely related languages. These languages are used
      to create shaders for each of the programmable processors contained in the OpenGL processing pipeline.
      Currently, these processors are the vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry,
      fragment, and compute processors.
      Unless otherwise noted in this paper, a language feature applies to all languages, and common usage will
      refer to these languages as a single language. The specific languages will be referred to by the name of
      the processor they target: vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, fragment, or
      compute.
      Most OpenGL state is not tracked or made available to shaders. Typically, user-defined variables will be
      used for communicating between different stages of the OpenGL pipeline. However, a small amount of
      state is still tracked and automatically made available to shaders, and there are a few built-in variables for
      interfaces between different stages of the OpenGL pipeline.

2.1   Vertex Processor
      The vertex processor is a programmable unit that operates on incoming vertices and their associated data.
      Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called vertex
      shaders. When a set of vertex shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result in a vertex shader
      executable that runs on the vertex processor.
      The vertex processor operates on one vertex at a time. It does not replace graphics operations that require
      knowledge of several vertices at a time.

2.2   Tessellation Control Processor
      The tessellation control processor is a programmable unit that operates on a patch of incoming vertices
      and their associated data, emitting a new output patch. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading
      Language to run on this processor are called tessellation control shaders. When a set of tessellation
      control shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result in a tessellation control shader
      executable that runs on the tessellation control processor.
      The tessellation control shader is invoked for each vertex of the output patch. Each invocation can read
      the attributes of any vertex in the input or output patches, but can only write per-vertex attributes for the
      corresponding output patch vertex. The shader invocations collectively produce a set of per-patch
      attributes for the output patch. After all tessellation control shader invocations have completed, the output
      vertices and per-patch attributes are assembled to form a patch to be used by subsequent pipeline stages.
      Tessellation control shader invocations run mostly independently, with undefined relative execution order.
      However, the built-in function barrier() can be used to control execution order by synchronizing
      invocations, effectively dividing tessellation control shader execution into a set of phases. Tessellation
      control shaders will get undefined results if one invocation reads a per-vertex or per-patch attribute




                                                      9
                                                                         2 Overview of OpenGL Shading



      written by another invocation at any point during the same phase, or if two invocations attempt to write
      different values to the same per-patch output in a single phase.

2.3   Tessellation Evaluation Processor
      The tessellation evaluation processor is a programmable unit that evaluates the position and other
      attributes of a vertex generated by the tessellation primitive generator, using a patch of incoming vertices
      and their associated data. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this
      processor are called tessellation evaluation shaders. When a set of tessellation evaluation shaders are
      successfully compiled and linked, they result in a tessellation evaluation shader executable that runs on
      the tessellation evaluation processor.
      Each invocation of the tessellation evaluation executable computes the position and attributes of a single
      vertex generated by the tessellation primitive generator. The executable can read the attributes of any
      vertex in the input patch, plus the tessellation coordinate, which is the relative location of the vertex in the
      primitive being tessellated. The executable writes the position and other attributes of the vertex.

2.4   Geometry Processor
      The geometry processor is a programmable unit that operates on data for incoming vertices for a primitive
      assembled after vertex processing and outputs a sequence of vertices forming output primitives.
      Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called geometry
      shaders. When a set of geometry shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result in a geometry
      shader executable that runs on the geometry processor.
      A single invocation of the geometry shader executable on the geometry processor will operate on a
      declared input primitive with a fixed number of vertices. This single invocation can emit a variable
      number of vertices that are assembled into primitives of a declared output primitive type and passed to
      subsequent pipeline stages.

2.5   Fragment Processor
      The fragment processor is a programmable unit that operates on fragment values and their associated
      data. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called
      fragment shaders. When a set of fragment shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result in a
      fragment shader executable that runs on the fragment processor.
      A fragment shader cannot change a fragment's (x, y) position. Access to neighboring fragments is not
      allowed. The values computed by the fragment shader are ultimately used to update framebuffer memory
      or texture memory, depending on the current OpenGL state and the OpenGL command that caused the
      fragments to be generated.

2.6   Compute Processor
      The compute processor is a programmable unit that operates independently from the other shader
      processors. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are
      called compute shaders. When a set of compute shaders are successfully compiled and linked, they result
      in a compute shader executable that runs on the compute processor.

                                                                2 Overview of OpenGL Shading



A compute shader has access to many of the same resources as fragment and other shader processors,
including textures, buffers, image variables, and atomic counters. It does not have any predefined inputs
nor any fixed-function outputs. It is not part of the graphics pipeline and its visible side effects are
through changes to images, storage buffers, and atomic counters.
A compute shader operates on a group of work items called a work group. A work group is a collection
of shader invocations that execute the same code, potentially in parallel. An invocation within a work
group may share data with other members of the same work group through shared variables and issue
memory and control barriers to synchronize with other members of the same work group.

3 Basics

3.1   Character Set and Phases of Compilation
      The source character set used for the OpenGL shading languages is Unicode in the UTF-8 encoding
      scheme. After preprocessing, only the following characters are allowed in the resulting stream of GLSL
      tokens:
            The letters a-z, A-Z, and the underscore ( _ ).
            The numbers 0-9.
            The symbols period (.), plus (+), dash (-), slash (/), asterisk (*), percent (%), angled brackets (< and
            >), square brackets ( [ and ] ), parentheses ( ( and ) ), braces ( { and } ), caret (^), vertical bar ( | ),
            ampersand (&), tilde (~), equals (=), exclamation point (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), comma (,), and
            question mark (?).
      A compile-time error will be given if any other character is used in a GLSL token.
      There are no digraphs or trigraphs. There are no escape sequences or uses of the backslash beyond use as
      the line-continuation character.
      Lines are relevant for compiler diagnostic messages and the preprocessor. They are terminated by
      carriage-return or line-feed. If both are used together, it will count as only a single line termination. For
      the remainder of this document, any of these combinations is simply referred to as a new line.
      In general, the languageâs use of this character set is case sensitive.
      There are no character or string data types, so no quoting characters are included.
      There is no end-of-file character.
      More formally, compilation happens as if the following logical phases were executed in order:
          1.   Source strings are concatenated to form a single input. All provided new lines are retained.
          2.   Line numbering is noted, based on all present new lines, and does not change when new lines are
               later eliminated.
          3.   Wherever a backslash ('\') occurs immediately before a new line, both are eliminated. (Note no
               white space is substituted, allowing a single token to span a new line.) Any newly formed
               backslash followed by a new line is not eliminated; only those pairs originally occurring after
               phase 1 are eliminated.
          4.   All comments are replaced with a single space. (Note that '//' style comments end before their
               terminating new lines and white space is generally relevant to preprocessing.)
          5.   Preprocessing is done, resulting in a sequence of GLSL tokens, formed from the character set
               stated above.
          6.   GLSL processing is done on the sequence of GLSL tokens.

                                                                                                      3 Basics



      Details that fully define source strings, comments, line numbering, new line elimination, and
      preprocessing are all discussed in upcoming sections. Sections beyond those describe GLSL processing.

3.2   Source Strings
      The source for a single shader is an array of strings of characters from the character set. A single shader
      is made from the concatenation of these strings. Each string can contain multiple lines, separated by new
      lines. No new lines need be present in a string; a single line can be formed from multiple strings. No new
      lines or other characters are inserted by the implementation when it concatenates the strings to form a
      single shader. Multiple shaders can be linked together to form a single program.
      Diagnostic messages returned from compiling a shader must identify both the line number within a string
      and which source string the message applies to. Source strings are counted sequentially with the first
      string being string 0. Line numbers are one more than the number of new lines that have been processed,
      including counting the new lines that will be removed by the line-continuation character ( \ ).
      Lines separated by the line-continuation character preceding a new line are concatenated together before
      either comment processing or preprocessing. No white space is substituted for the line-continuation
      character. That is, a single token could be formed by the concatenation by taking the characters at the end
      of one line concatenating them with the characters at the beginning of the next line.




                                                    13
                                                                                                      3 Basics



         float f\
         oo;
         // forms a single line equivalent to âfloat foo;â
         // (assuming '\' is the last character before the new line and âooâ are
         // the first two characters of the next line)


3.3   Preprocessor
      There is a preprocessor that processes the source strings as part of the compilation process. Except as
      noted below, it behaves as the C++ standard preprocessor (see section 10 âNormative Referencesâ).
      The complete list of preprocessor directives is as follows.
         #
         #define
         #undef

         #if
         #ifdef
         #ifndef
         #else
         #elif
         #endif

         #error
         #pragma

         #extension
         #version

         #line

      The following operators are also available
         defined
         ##

      Each number sign (#) can be preceded in its line only by spaces or horizontal tabs. It may also be
      followed by spaces and horizontal tabs, preceding the directive. Each directive is terminated by a new
      line. Preprocessing does not change the number or relative location of new lines in a source string.
      Preprocessing takes places after new lines have been removed by the line-continuation character.
      The number sign (#) on a line by itself is ignored. Any directive not listed above will cause a diagnostic
      message and make the implementation treat the shader as ill-formed.
      #define and #undef functionality are defined as is standard for C++ preprocessors for macro definitions
      both with and without macro parameters.
      The following predefined macros are available




                                                     14
                                                                                                  3 Basics



   __LINE__
   __FILE__
   __VERSION__

__LINE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that is one more than the number of preceding new
lines in the current source string.
__FILE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that says which source string number is currently
being processed.
__VERSION__ will substitute a decimal integer reflecting the version number of the OpenGL shading
language. The version of the shading language described in this document will have __VERSION__
substitute the decimal integer 440.
All macro names containing two consecutive underscores ( __ ) are reserved for future use as predefined
macro names. All macro names prefixed with âGL_â (âGLâ followed by a single underscore) are also
reserved.
#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif are defined to operate as is standard for C++ preprocessors.
Expressions following #if and #elif are further restricted to expressions operating on literal integer
constants, plus identifiers consumed by the defined operator. Character constants are not supported.
The operators available are as follows.

The defined operator can be used in either of the following ways:
   defined identifier
   defined ( identifier )

Two tokens in a macro can be concatenated into one token using the token pasting (##) operator, as is
standard for C++ preprocessors. The result must be a valid single token, which will then be subject to
macro expansion. That is, macro expansion happens only after token pasting. There are no other number
sign based operators (e.g., no # or #@), nor is there a sizeof operator.
The semantics of applying operators to integer literals in the preprocessor match those standard in the C+
+ preprocessor, not those in the OpenGL Shading Language.
Preprocessor expressions will be evaluated according to the behavior of the host processor, not the
processor targeted by the shader.
#error will cause the implementation to put a compile-time diagnostic message into the shader objectâs
information log (see section 7.12 âShader and Program Queriesâ in the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification for how to access a shader objectâs information log). The message will be the tokens
following the #error directive, up to the first new line. The implementation must then consider the shader
to be ill-formed.
#pragma allows implementation dependent compiler control. Tokens following #pragma are not subject
to preprocessor macro expansion. If an implementation does not recognize the tokens following
#pragma, then it will ignore that pragma. The following pragmas are defined as part of the language.
   #pragma STDGL

The STDGL pragma is used to reserve pragmas for use by future revisions of this language. No
implementation may use a pragma whose first token is STDGL.
   #pragma optimize(on)
   #pragma optimize(off)

can be used to turn off optimizations as an aid in developing and debugging shaders. It can only be used
outside function definitions. By default, optimization is turned on for all shaders. The debug pragma
   #pragma debug(on)
   #pragma debug(off)

can be used to enable compiling and annotating a shader with debug information, so that it can be used
with a debugger. It can only be used outside function definitions. By default, debug is turned off.
Shaders should declare the version of the language they are written to. The language version a shader is
written to is specified by
   #version number profileopt

where number must be a version of the language, following the same convention as __VERSION__ above.
The directive â#version 440â is required in any shader that uses version 4.40 of the language. Any
number representing a version of the language a compiler does not support will cause a compile-time
error to be generated. Version 1.10 of the language does not require shaders to include this directive, and
shaders that do not include a #version directive will be treated as targeting version 1.10. Shaders that

                                                                                                  3 Basics



specify #version 100 will be treated as targeting version 1.00 of the OpenGL ES Shading Language.
Shaders that specify #version 300 will be treated as targeting version 3.00 of the OpenGL ES Shading
Language.
If the optional profile argument is provided, it must be the name of an OpenGL profile. Currently, there
are three choices:
   core
   compatibility
   es

A profile argument can only be used with version 150 or greater. If no profile argument is provided and
the version is 150 or greater, the default is core. If version 300 is specified, the profile argument is not
optional and must be es, or a compile-time error results. The Language Specification for the es profile is
specified in The OpenGL ES Shading Language specification.
Shaders for the core or compatibility profiles that declare different versions can be linked together.
However, es profile shaders cannot be linked with non-es profile shaders or with es profile shaders of a
different version, or a link-time error will result. When linking shaders of versions allowed by these rules,
remaining link-time errors will be given as per the linking rules in the GLSL version corresponding to the
version of the context the shaders are linked under. Shader compile-time errors must still be given strictly
based on the version declared (or defaulted to) within each shader.
Unless otherwise specified, this specification is documenting the core profile, and everything specified for
the core profile is also available in the compatibility profile. Features specified as belonging specifically
to the compatibility profile are not available in the core profile.
There is a built-in macro definition for each profile the implementation supports. All implementations
provide the following macro:
   #define GL_core_profile 1

Implementations providing the compatibility profile provide the following macro:
   #define GL_compatibility_profile 1

Implementations providing the es profile provide the following macro:
   #define GL_es_profile 1


The #version directive must occur in a shader before anything else, except for comments and white space.




                                                17
                                                                                                  3 Basics



By default, compilers of this language must issue compile-time lexical and grammatical errors for shaders
that do not conform to this specification. Any extended behavior must first be enabled. Directives to
control the behavior of the compiler with respect to extensions are declared with the #extension directive
   #extension extension_name : behavior
   #extension all : behavior

where extension_name is the name of an extension. Extension names are not documented in this
specification. The token all means the behavior applies to all extensions supported by the compiler. The
behavior can be one of the following

 behavior                  Effect
         require           Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Give a compile-time error on the #extension if the extension extension_name
                           is not supported, or if all is specified.


         enable            Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.
                           Give a compile-time error on the #extension if all is specified.


          warn             Behave as specified by the extension extension_name, except issue warnings
                           on any detectable use of that extension, unless such use is supported by other
                           enabled or required extensions.
                           If all is specified, then warn on all detectable uses of any extension used.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.


         disable           Behave (including issuing errors and warnings) as if the extension
                           extension_name is not part of the language definition.
                           If all is specified, then behavior must revert back to that of the non-extended
                           core version of the language being compiled to.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.



The extension directive is a simple, low-level mechanism to set the behavior for each extension. It does
not define policies such as which combinations are appropriate, those must be defined elsewhere. Order
of directives matters in setting the behavior for each extension: Directives that occur later override those
seen earlier. The all variant sets the behavior for all extensions, overriding all previously issued
extension directives, but only for the behaviors warn and disable.




                                               18
                                                                                                        3 Basics



      The initial state of the compiler is as if the directive
         #extension all : disable

      was issued, telling the compiler that all error and warning reporting must be done according to this
      specification, ignoring any extensions.
      Each extension can define its allowed granularity of scope. If nothing is said, the granularity is a shader
      (that is, a single compilation unit), and the extension directives must occur before any non-preprocessor
      tokens. If necessary, the linker can enforce granularities larger than a single compilation unit, in which
      case each involved shader will have to contain the necessary extension directive.
      Macro expansion is not done on lines containing #extension and #version directives.
      #line must have, after macro substitution, one of the following forms:
         #line line
         #line line source-string-number

      where line and source-string-number are constant integer expressions. After processing this directive
      (including its new line), the implementation will behave as if it is compiling at line number line and source
      string number source-string-number. Subsequent source strings will be numbered sequentially, until
      another #line directive overrides that numbering.

3.4   Comments
      Comments are delimited by /* and */, or by // and a new line. The begin comment delimiters (/* or //) are
      not recognized as comment delimiters inside of a comment, hence comments cannot be nested. A /*
      comment includes its terminating delimiter (*/). However, a // comment does not include (or eliminate)
      its terminating new line.
      Inside comments, any byte values may be used, except a byte whose value is 0. No errors will be given
      for the content of comments and no validation on the content of comments need be done.
      Removal of new lines by the line-continuation character ( \ ) logically occurs before comments are
      processed. That is, a single-line comment ending in the line-continuation character ( \ ) includes the next
      line in the comment.
         // a single-line comment containing the next line \
         a = b; // this is still in the first comment

3.5   Tokens
      The language, after preprocessing, is a sequence of GLSL tokens. A token can be

           token:
                keyword
                identifier
                integer-constant
                floating-constant
                operator
                ; { }

      The following are the language's keywords and (after preprocessing) can only be used as described in this
      specification, or a compile-time error results:

      In addition, all identifiers containing two consecutive underscores (__) are reserved as possible future
      keywords.

3.7   Identifiers
      Identifiers are used for variable names, function names, structure names, and field selectors (field
      selectors select components of vectors and matrices similar to structure members, as discussed in section
      5.5 âVector and Scalar Componentsâ and section 5.6 âMatrix Componentsâ ). Identifiers have the form

           identifier
                nondigit
                identifier nondigit
                identifier digit
           nondigit: one of
               _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
               ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
           digit: one of
                 0123456789


      Identifiers starting with âgl_â are reserved for use by OpenGL, and may not be declared in a shader as
      either a variable or a function; this results in a compile-time error. However, as noted in the specification,
      there are some cases where previously declared variables can be redeclared, and predeclared "gl_" names
      are allowed to be redeclared in a shader only for these specific purposes. More generally, it is a compile-
      time error to redeclare a variable, including those starting âgl_â.

3.8   Definitions
      Some language rules described below depend on the following definitions.




                                                         22
                                                                                                           3 Basics



3.8.1   Static Use
        A shader contains a static use of (or static assignment to) a variable x if, after preprocessing, the shader
        contains a statement that would read (or write) x, whether or not run-time flow of control will cause that
        statement to be executed.

3.8.2   Uniform and Non-Uniform Control Flow
        When executing statements in a fragment shader, control flow starts as uniform control flow; all fragments
        enter the same control path into main(). Control flow becomes non-uniform when different fragments
        take different paths through control-flow statements (selection, iteration, and jumps). Control flow
        subsequently returns to being uniform after such divergent sub-statements or skipped code completes,
        until the next time different control paths are taken.
        For example:
           main()
           {
               float a = ...;//          this is uniform flow control
               if (a < b) { //           this expression is true for some fragments, not all
                   ....;     //          non-uniform flow control
               } else {
                   ....;     //          non-uniform flow control
               }
               ....;         //          uniform flow control again
           }

        Other examples of non-uniform flow control can occur within switch statements and after conditional
        breaks, continues, early returns, and after fragment discards, when the condition is true for some
        fragments but not others. Loop iterations that only some fragments execute are also non-uniform flow
        control.
        This is similarly defined for other shader stages, based on the per-instance data items they process.

3.8.3   Dynamically Uniform Expressions
        A fragment-shader expression is dynamically uniform if all fragments evaluating it get the same resulting
        value. When loops are involved, this refers to the expression's value for the same loop iteration. When
        functions are involved, this refers to calls from the same call point.
        This is similarly defined for other shader stages, based on the per-instance data they process.
        Note that constant expressions are trivially dynamically uniform. It follows that typical loop counters
        based on these are also dynamically uniform.

4 Variables and Types

      All variables and functions must be declared before being used. Variable and function names are
      identifiers.
      There are no default types. All variable and function declarations must have a declared type, and
      optionally qualifiers. A variable is declared by specifying its type followed by one or more names
      separated by commas. In many cases, a variable can be initialized as part of its declaration by using the
      assignment operator (=).
      User-defined types may be defined using struct to aggregate a list of existing types into a single name.
      The OpenGL Shading Language is type safe. There are some implicit conversions between types.
      Exactly how and when this can occur is described in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ and as
      referenced by other sections in this specification.

4.1   Basic Types
      The OpenGL Shading Language supports the following basic data types, grouped as follows.
      Transparent types

           Type                         Meaning
           void                         for functions that do not return a value
           bool                         a conditional type, taking on values of true or false

        In addition, a shader can aggregate these basic types using arrays and structures to build more complex
        types.
        There are no pointer types.

4.1.1   Void
        Functions that do not return a value must be declared as void. There is no default function return type.
        The keyword void cannot be used in any other declarations (except for empty formal or actual parameter
        lists), or a compile-time error results.

4.1.2   Booleans
        To make conditional execution of code easier to express, the type bool is supported. There is no
        expectation that hardware directly supports variables of this type. It is a genuine Boolean type, holding
        only one of two values meaning either true or false. Two keywords true and false can be used as literal
        Boolean constants. Booleans are declared and optionally initialized as in the follow example:
           bool success;      // declare âsuccessâ to be a Boolean
           bool done = false; // declare and initialize âdoneâ

        The right side of the assignment operator ( = ) must be an expression whose type is bool.
        Expressions used for conditional jumps (if, for, ?:, while, do-while) must evaluate to the type bool.

4.1.3   Integers
        Signed and unsigned integer variables are fully supported. In this document, the term integer is meant to
        generally include both signed and unsigned integers. Unsigned integers have exactly 32 bits of precision.
        Signed integers use 32 bits, including a sign bit, in two's complement form. Addition, subtraction, and
        shift operations resulting in overflow or underflow will not cause any exception, nor will they saturate,
        rather they will âwrapâ to yield the low-order 32 bits of the result. Division and multiplication operations
        resulting in overflow or underflow will not cause any exception but will result in an undefined value.
        Integers are declared and optionally initialized with integer expressions, as in the following example:
           int i, j = 42;        // default integer literal type is int
           uint k = 3u;          // âuâ establishes the type as uint




                                                       28
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



Literal integer constants can be expressed in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16)
as follows.

     integer-constant :
          decimal-constant integer-suffixopt
          octal-constant integer-suffixopt
          hexadecimal-constant integer-suffixopt
     integer-suffix: one of
          u U
     decimal-constant :
         nonzero-digit
         decimal-constant digit
     octal-constant :
          0
          octal-constant octal-digit
     hexadecimal-constant :
         0x hexadecimal-digit
         0X hexadecimal-digit
         hexadecimal-constant hexadecimal-digit
     digit :
           0
           nonzero-digit
     nonzero-digit : one of
         123456789
     octal-digit : one of
          01234567
     hexadecimal-digit : one of
         0123456789
         abcdef
         ABCDEF
No white space is allowed between the digits of an integer constant, including after the leading 0 or after
the leading 0x or 0X of a constant, or before the suffix u or U. When tokenizing, the maximal token
matching the above will be recognized before a new token is started. When the suffix u or U is present,
the literal has type uint, otherwise the type is int. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted as an
arithmetic unary negation, not as part of the constant. Hence, literals themselves are always expressed
with non-negative syntax, though they could result in a negative value.
It is a compile-time error to provide a literal integer whose bit pattern cannot fit in 32 bits. The bit pattern
of the literal is always used unmodified. So a signed literal whose bit pattern includes a set sign bit
creates a negative value. For example,

                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



           int    a   =   0xffffffff;
                                //            32 bits, a gets the value -1
           int    b   =   0xffffffffU;
                                //            ERROR: can't convert uint to int
           uint   c   =   0xffffffff;
                                //            32 bits, c gets the value 0xFFFFFFFF
           uint   d   =   0xffffffffU;
                                //            32 bits, d gets the value 0xFFFFFFFF
           int    e   =   -1;   //            the literal is â1â, then negation is performed,
                                //              and the resulting non-literal 32-bit signed
                                //              bit pattern of 0xFFFFFFFF is assigned, giving e
                                //              the value of -1.
           uint f = -1u;        //            the literal is â1uâ, then negation is performed,
                                //              and the resulting non-literal 32-bit unsigned
                                //              bit pattern of 0xFFFFFFFF is assigned, giving f
                                //              the value of 0xFFFFFFFF.
           int g = 3000000000; //             a signed decimal literal taking 32 bits,
                                //              setting the sign bit, g gets -1294967296
           int h = 0xA0000000; //             okay, 32-bit signed hexadecimal
           int i = 5000000000; //             ERROR: needs more than 32 bits
           int j = 0xFFFFFFFFF; //            ERROR: needs more than 32 bits
           int k = 0x80000000; //             k gets -2147483648 == 0x80000000
           int l = 2147483648; //             l gets -2147483648 (the literal set the sign bit)


        Despite all these examples initializing variables, literals are recognized and given values and types
        independently of their context.

4.1.4   Floating-Point Variables
        Single-precision and double-precision floating point variables are available for use in a variety of scalar
        calculations. Generally, the term floating-point will refer to both single- and double-precision floating
        point. Floating-point variables are defined as in the following examples:
           float a, b = 1.5;              // single-precision floating-point
           double c, d = 2.0LF;           // double-precision floating-point

        As an input value to one of the processing units, a single-precision or double-precision floating-point
        variable is expected to match the corresponding IEEE 754 floating-point definition for precision and
        dynamic range. Floating-point variables within a shader are also encoded according to the IEEE 754
        specification for single-precision floating-point values (logically, not necessarily physically). While
        encodings are logically IEEE 754, operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) are not necessarily performed
        as required by IEEE 754. See section 4.7.1 âRange and Precisionâ for more details on precision and
        usage of NaNs (Not a Number) and Infs (positive or negative infinities).

        Floating-point constants are defined as follows.

             floating-constant :
                   fractional-constant exponent-partopt floating-suffixopt
                  digit-sequence exponent-part floating-suffixopt
             fractional-constant :
                  digit-sequence . digit-sequence
                  digit-sequence .
                  . digit-sequence
             exponent-part :
                 e signopt digit-sequence
                 E signopt digit-sequence

             sign : one of
                  +â
             digit-sequence :
                   digit
                   digit-sequence digit
             floating-suffix: one of
                   f F lf LF
        A decimal point ( . ) is not needed if the exponent part is present. No white space may appear anywhere
        within a floating-point constant, including before a suffix. When tokenizing, the maximal token matching
        the above will be recognized before a new token is started. When the suffix "lf" or "LF" is present, the
        literal has type double. Otherwise, the literal has type float. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted
        as a unary operator and is not part of the floating-point constant.

4.1.5   Vectors
        The OpenGL Shading Language includes data types for generic 2-, 3-, and 4-component vectors of
        floating-point values, integers, or Booleans. Floating-point vector variables can be used to store colors,
        normals, positions, texture coordinates, texture lookup results and the like. Boolean vectors can be used
        for component-wise comparisons of numeric vectors. Some examples of vector declaration are:
           vec2 texcoord1, texcoord2;
           vec3 position;
           vec4 myRGBA;
           ivec2 textureLookup;
           bvec3 less;

        Initialization of vectors can be done with constructors, which are discussed shortly.

4.1.6   Matrices
        The OpenGL Shading Language has built-in types for 2Ã2, 2Ã3, 2Ã4, 3Ã2, 3Ã3, 3Ã4, 4Ã2, 4Ã3, and 4Ã4
        matrices of floating-point numbers. Matrix types beginning with "mat" have single-precision components




                                                        31
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



        while matrix types beginning with "dmat" have double-precision components. The first number in the
        type is the number of columns, the second is the number of rows. If there is only one number, the matrix
        is square. Example matrix declarations:
           mat2 mat2D;
           mat3 optMatrix;
           mat4 view, projection;
           mat4x4 view; // an alternate way of declaring a mat4
           mat3x2 m;     // a matrix with 3 columns and 2 rows
           dmat4 highPrecisionMVP;
           dmat2x4 dm;

        Initialization of matrix values is done with constructors (described in section 5.4 âConstructorsâ ) in
        column-major order.

4.1.7   Opaque Types
        The opaque types declare variables that are effectively opaque handles to other objects. These objects are
        accessed through built-in functions, not through direct reading or writing of the declared variable. They
        can only be declared as function parameters or in uniform-qualified variables. The only opaque types
        that take memory qualifiers are the image types. Except for array indexing, structure member selection,
        and parentheses, opaque variables are not allowed to be operands in expressions; such use results in a
        compile-time error.
        Opaque variables cannot be treated as l-values; hence cannot be used as out or inout function parameters,
        nor can they be assigned into. Any such use results in a compile-time error. However, they can be passed
        as in parameters with matching type and memory qualifiers. They are initialized only through the
        OpenGL API; they cannot be declared with an initializer in a shader.
        Because a single opaque type declaration effectively declares two objects, the opaque handle itself and the
        object it is a handle to, there is room for both a storage qualifier and a memory qualifier. The storage
        qualifier will qualify the opaque handle, while the memory qualifier will qualify the object it is a handle
        to.

4.1.7.1 Samplers
        Sampler types (e.g., sampler2D) are opaque types, declared and behaving as described above for opaque
        types. When aggregated into arrays within a shader, samplers can only be indexed with a dynamically
        uniform integral expression, otherwise results are undefined.
        Sampler variables are handles to one-, two-, and three- dimensional textures, cube maps, depth textures
        (shadowing), etc., as enumerated in the basic types tables. There are distinct sampler types for each
        texture target, and for each of float, integer, and unsigned integer data types. Texture accesses are done
        through built-in texture functions (described in section 8.9 âTexture Functionsâ) and samplers are used to
        specify which texture to access and how it is to be filtered.




                                                       32
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



4.1.7.2 Images
        Image types are opaque types, declared and behaving as described above for opaque types. They can be
        further qualified with memory qualifiers. When aggregated into arrays within a shader, images can only
        be indexed with a dynamically uniform integral expression, otherwise results are undefined.
        Image variables are handles to one-, two-, or three-dimensional images corresponding to all or a portion
        of a single level of a texture image bound to an image unit. There are distinct image types for each texture
        target, and for each of float, integer, and unsigned integer data types. Image accesses should use an image
        type that matches the target of the texture whose level is bound to the image unit, or for non-layered
        bindings of 3D or array images should use the image type that matches the dimensionality of the layer of
        the image (i.e., a layer of 3D, 2DArray, Cube, or CubeArray should use image2D, a layer of 1DArray
        should use image1D, and a layer of 2DMSArray should use image2DMS). If the image target type does
        not match the bound image in this manner, if the data type does not match the bound image, or if the
        format layout qualifier does not match the image unit format as described in section 8.25 âTexture Image
        Loads and Storesâ of the OpenGL Specification, the results of image accesses are undefined but cannot
        include program termination.
        Image variables are used in the image load, store, and atomic functions described in section 8.12 "Image
        Functions" to specify an image to access.

4.1.7.3 Atomic Counters
        Atomic counter types (atomic_uint) are opaque handles to counters, declared and behaving as described
        above for opaque types. The variables they declare specify which counter to access when using the built-
        in atomic counter functions as described in section 8.10 âAtomic Counter Functionsâ. They are bound to
        buffers as described in section 4.4.6.1 âAtomic Counter Layout Qualifiersâ. When aggregated into arrays
        within a shader, atomic counters can only be indexed with a dynamically uniform integral expression,
        otherwise results are undefined. Members of structures cannot be declared as atomic counter types.

4.1.8   Structures
        User-defined types can be created by aggregating other already defined types into a structure using the
        struct keyword. For example,
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           } lightVar;

        In this example, light becomes the name of the new type, and lightVar becomes a variable of type light.
        To declare variables of the new type, use its name (without the keyword struct).
           light lightVar2;




                                                       33
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        More formally, structures are declared as follows. However, the complete correct grammar is as given in
        section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ .

             struct-definition :
                  qualifieropt struct nameopt { member-list } declaratorsopt ;

             member-list :
                member-declaration;
                member-declaration member-list;
             member-declaration :
                basic-type declarators;
        where name becomes the user-defined type, and can be used to declare variables to be of this new type.
        The name shares the same name space as other variables, types, and functions. All previously visible
        variables, types, constructors, or functions with that name are hidden. The optional qualifier only applies
        to any declarators, and is not part of the type being defined for name.
        Structures must have at least one member declaration. Member declarators may contain precision
        qualifiers, but use of any other qualifier results in a compile-time error. Bit fields are not supported.
        Member types must be already defined (there are no forward references). A compile-time error results if a
        member declaration contains an initializer. Member declarators can contain arrays. Such arrays must
        have a size specified, and the size must be an integral constant expression that's greater than zero (see
        section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ). Each level of structure has its own name space for names given in
        member declarators; such names need only be unique within that name space.
        Anonymous structures are not supported. Embedded structure definitions are not supported. These result
        in compile-time errors.
           struct S { float f; };

           struct T {
                  S;              // Error: anonymous structures disallowed
                  struct { ... }; // Error: embedded structures disallowed
                  S s;            // Okay: nested structures with name are allowed
           };

        Structures can be initialized at declaration time using constructors, as discussed in section 5.4.3 âStructure
        Constructorsâ .
        Any restrictions on the usage of a type or qualifier also apply to any structure that contains a member of
        that type or qualifier. This also applies to structure members that are structures, recursively.

4.1.9   Arrays
        Variables of the same type can be aggregated into arrays by declaring a name followed by brackets ( [ ] )
        enclosing an optional size. When an array size is specified in a declaration, it must be an integral constant
        expression (see section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ) greater than zero. Except for the last declared
        member of a shader storage block (section 4.3.9 âInterface Blocksâ), the size of an array must be declared
        before it is indexed with anything other than an integral constant expression. The size of any array must
        be declared before passing it as an argument to a function. Violation of any of these rules result in




                                                        34
                                                                             4 Variables and Types



compile-time errors. It is legal to declare an array without a size and then later redeclare the same name
as an array of the same type and specify a size. However, unless noted otherwise, blocks cannot be
redeclared; an unsized array in a user-declared block cannot be sized by a block redeclaration. It is a
compile-time error to declare an array with a size, and then later (in the same shader) index the same array
with an integral constant expression greater than or equal to the declared size. It is also a compile-time
error to index an array with a negative constant expression. Arrays declared as formal parameters in a
function declaration must specify a size. Undefined behavior results from indexing an array with a non-
constant expression thatâs greater than or equal to the arrayâs size or less than 0. Arrays only have a
single dimension (a single entry within "[ ]"), however, arrays of arrays can be declared. All types (basic
types, structures, arrays) can be formed into an array.
All arrays are inherently homogeneous; made of elements all having the same type and size, with one
exception. The exception is a shader storage block having an unsized array as its last member; an array
can be formed from such a shader storage block, even if the storage blocks have differing lengths for their
last member.
Some examples are:
   float frequencies[3];
   uniform vec4 lightPosition[4];
   light lights[];
   const int numLights = 2;
   light lights[numLights];

   // a shader storage block, introduced in section 4.3.7 âbuffer variablesâ
   buffer b {
       float u[]; // an error, unless u gets statically sized by link time
       vec4 v[];   // okay, v will be sized dynamically, if not statically
   } name[3];      // when the block is arrayed, all u will be the same size,
                   //        but not necessarily all v, if sized dynamically

An array type can be formed by specifying a type followed by square brackets ([ ]) and including a size:
   float[5]

This type can be used anywhere any other type can be used, including as the return value from a function
   float[5] foo() { }

as a constructor of an array
   float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1)

as an unnamed parameter
   void foo(float[5])

and as an alternate way of declaring a variable or function parameter.
   float[5] a;

Arrays can have initializers formed from array constructors:




                                               35
                                                                                  4 Variables and Types



   float a[5] = float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1);
   float a[5] = float[](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1); // same thing

An array of arrays can be declared as
   vec4 a[3][2];         // size-3 array of size-2 array of vec4

which declares a one-dimensional array of size 3 of one-dimensional arrays of size 2 of vec4s. These
following declarations do the same thing:
   vec4[2] a[3];         // size-3 array of size-2 array of vec4
   vec4[3][2] a;         // size-3 array of size-2 array of vec4

When in transparent memory (like in a uniform block), the layout is that the inner-most (right-most in
declaration) dimensions iterate faster than outer dimensions. That is, for the above, the order in memory
would be:
      Low address : a[0][0] : a[0][1] : a[1][0] : a[1][1] : a[2][0] : a[2][1] : High address
The type of a needed for both constructors and nameless parameters is âvec4[3][2]â:
   vec4 b[2] = vec4[2](vec4(0.0), vec4(0.1));
   vec4[3][2] a = vec4[3][2](b, b, b);        // constructor
   void foo(vec4[3][2]); // prototype with unnamed parameter

Alternatively, the initializer-list syntax can be used to initialize an array of arrays:
   vec4 a[3][2] = { vec4[2](vec4(0.0), vec4(1.0)),
                    vec4[2](vec4(0.0), vec4(1.0)),
                    vec4[2](vec4(0.0), vec4(1.0)) };


Unsized arrays can be explicitly sized by an initializer at declaration time:
   float    a[5];
   ...
   float    b[] = a; // b is explicitly size 5
   float    b[5] = a; // means the same thing
   float    b[] = float[](1,2,3,4,5); // also explicitly sizes to 5

However, it is a compile-time error to assign to an implicitly sized array. Note, this is a rare case that
initializers and assignments appear to have different semantics.
Arrays know the number of elements they contain. This can be obtained by using the length method:
   float a[5];
   a.length();        // returns 5

This returns a type int. If an array has been explicitly sized, the value returned by the length method is a
constant expression. If an array has not been explicitly sized and is not the last declared member of a
shader storage block, the value returned by the length method is not a constant expression and will be
determined when a program is linked. If an array has not been explicitly sized and is the last declared
member of a shader storage block, the value returned will not be a constant expression and will be




                                                  36
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



determined at run time based on the size of the buffer object providing storage for the block. For such
arrays, the value returned by the length method will be undefined if the array is contained in an array of
shader storage blocks that is indexed with a non-constant expression less than zero or greater than or
equal to the number of blocks in the array.
The length method cannot be called on an array that has not yet been explicitly sized; this results in a
compile-time error.
The length method works equally well for arrays of arrays:
   vec4 a[3][2];
   a.length()           // this is 3
   a[x].length()        // this is 2


When the length method returns a constant, the expression in brackets (x above) will be evaluated and
subjected to the rules required for array indexes, but the array will not be dereferenced. Thus, behavior is
well defined even if the run-time value of the expression is out of bounds.
When the length method returns a run-time value, the array will be dereferenced with the value x. If x is
not a compile-time constant and is out of range, an undefined value results.

   // for an array b containing a member array a:
   b[++x].a.length();    // b is never dereferenced, but â++xâ is evaluated

   // for an array s of a shader storage object containing a member array a:
   s[x].a.length();      // s is dereferenced; x needs to be a valid index


For unsized arrays, only the outermost dimension can be lacking a size. A type that includes an unknown
array size cannot be formed into an array until it gets an explicit size, except for shader storage blocks
where the only unsized array member is the last member of the block.
In a shader storage block, the last member may be declared without an explicit size. In this case, the
effective array size is inferred at run-time from the size of the data store backing the interface block. Such
unsized arrays may be indexed with general integer expressions. However, it is a compile-time error to
pass them as an argument to a function or index them with a negative constant expression.

4.1.10 Implicit Conversions
       In some situations, an expression and its type will be implicitly converted to a different type. The
       following table shows all allowed implicit conversions:

                 Type of expression            Can be implicitly converted to

        There are no implicit array or structure conversions. For example, an array of int cannot be implicitly
        converted to an array of float.
        When an implicit conversion is done, it is not a re-interpretation of the expression's bit pattern, but a
        conversion of its value to an equivalent value in the new type. For example, the integer value -5 will be
        converted to the floating-point value -5.0. Integer values having more bits of precision than a single-
        precision floating-point mantissa will lose precision when converted to float.
        When performing implicit conversion for binary operators, there may be multiple data types to which the
        two operands can be converted. For example, when adding an int value to a uint value, both values can
        be implicitly converted to uint, float, and double. In such cases, a floating-point type is chosen if either
        operand has a floating-point type. Otherwise, an unsigned integer type is chosen if either operand has an
        unsigned integer type. Otherwise, a signed integer type is chosen. If operands can be implicitly converted
        to multiple data types deriving from the same base data type, the type with the smallest component size is
        used.
        The conversions in the table above are done only as indicated by other sections of this specification.

4.1.11 Initializers
        At declaration, an initial value for an aggregate variable may be provided, specified as an equals (=)
        followed by an initializer. The initializer is either an assignment-expression or a list of initializers
        enclosed in curly braces. The grammar for the initializer is:

             initializer :
                   assignment-expression
                   { initializer-list }
                   { initializer-list , }
             initializer-list :
                   initializer
                   initializer-list , initializer
        The assignment-expression is a normal expression except that a comma ( , ) outside parentheses is
        interpreted as the end of the initializer, not as the sequence operator. As explained in more detail below,
        this allows creation of nested initializers: The aggregate and its initializer must exactly match in terms of
        nesting, number of components/elements/members present at each level, and types of
        components/elements/members.
        An assignment-expression in an initializer must be either the same type as the object it initializes or be a
        type that can be converted to the object's type according to section 4.1.10 "Implicit Conversions". Since
        these include constructors, an aggregate can be initialized by either a constructor or an initializer list; an
        element in an initializer list can be a constructor.
        If an initializer is a list of initializers enclosed in curly braces, the variable being declared must be a
        vector, a matrix, an array, or a structure.
           int i = { 1 };                  // illegal, i is not an aggregate




                                                         39
                                                                                 4 Variables and Types



A list of initializers enclosed in a matching set of curly braces is applied to one aggregate. This may be
the variable being declared or an aggregate contained in the variable being declared. Individual
initializers from the initializer list are applied to the elements/members of the aggregate, in order.
If the aggregate has a vector type, initializers from the list are applied to the components of the vector, in
order, starting with component 0. The number of initializers must match the number of components.
If the aggregate has a matrix type, initializers from the list must be vector initializers and are applied to
the columns of the matrix, in order, starting with column 0. The number of initializers must match the
number of columns.
If the aggregate has a structure type, initializers from the list are applied to the members of the structure,
in the order declared in the structure, starting with the first member. The number of initializers must
match the number of members.
Applying these rules, the following matrix declarations are equivalent:
   mat2x2 a = mat2( vec2( 1.0, 0.0 ), vec2( 0.0, 1.0 ) );
   mat2x2 b =      { vec2( 1.0, 0.0 ), vec2( 0.0, 1.0 ) };
   mat2x2 c =      {     { 1.0, 0.0 },     { 0.0, 1.0 } };

All of the following declarations result in a compile-time error.
   float a[2] = { 3.4, 4.2, 5.0 };         // illegal
   vec2 b = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 };             // illegal
   mat3x3 c = { vec3(0.0), vec3(1.0), vec3(2.0), vec3(3.0) };    // illegal
   mat2x2 d = { 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 };      // illegal, can't flatten nesting
   struct {
       float a;
       int   b;
   } e = { 1.2, 2, 3 };                    // illegal

In all cases, the innermost initializer (i.e., not a list of initializers enclosed in curly braces) applied to an
object must have the same type as the object being initialized or be a type that can be converted to the
object's type according to section 4.1.10 "Implicit Conversions". In the latter case, an implicit conversion
will be done on the initializer before the assignment is done.
   struct {
       float a;
       int   b;
   } e = { 1.2, 2 };                           // legal, all types match




                                                 40
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



         struct {
             float a;
             int   b;
         } e = { 1, 3 };                            // legal, first initializer is converted

      All of the following declarations result in a compile-time error.
         int a = true;                                            // illegal
         vec4 b[2] = { vec4(0.0), 1.0 };                          // illegal
         mat4x2 c = { vec3(0.0), vec3(1.0) };                     // illegal

         struct S1 {
             vec4 a;
             vec4 b;
         };

         struct {
             float s;
             float t;
         } d[] = { S1(vec4(0.0), vec4(1.1)) };                    // illegal

      If an initializer (of either form) is provided for an unsized array, the size of the array is determined by the
      number of top-level (non-nested) initializers within the initializer. All of the following declarations create
      arrays explicitly sized with five elements:
         float    a[] = float[](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1);
         float    b[] = { 3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1 };
         float    c[] = a;                           // c is explicitly size 5
         float    d[5] = b;                          // means the same thing


      It is a compile-time error to have too few or too many initializers in an initializer list for the aggregate
      being initialized. That is, all elements of an array, all members of a structure, all columns of a matrix, and
      all components of a vector must have exactly one initializer expression present, with no unconsumed
      initializers.

4.2   Scoping
      The scope of a variable is determined by where it is declared. If it is declared outside all function
      definitions, it has global scope, which starts from where it is declared and persists to the end of the shader
      it is declared in. If it is declared in a while test or a for statement, then it is scoped to the end of the
      following sub-statement. If it is declared in an if or else statement, it is scoped to the end of that
      statement. (See section 6.2 âSelectionâ and section 6.3 âIterationâ for the location of statements and sub-
      statements.) Otherwise, if it is declared as a statement within a compound statement, it is scoped to the
      end of that compound statement. If it is declared as a parameter in a function definition, it is scoped until
      the end of that function definition. A function's parameter declarations and body together form a single
      scope nested in the global scope. The if statementâs expression does not allow new variables to be
      declared, hence does not form a new scope.




                                                      41
                                                                              4 Variables and Types



Within a declaration, the scope of a name starts immediately after the initializer if present or immediately
after the name being declared if not. Several examples:
   int x = 1;
   {
          int x = 2, y = x; // y is initialized to 2
   }

   struct S
   {
          int x;
   };

   {
            S S = S(0);         // 'S' is only visible as a struct and constructor
            S;                  // 'S' is now visible as a variable
   }

   int x = x;                  // Error if x has not been previously defined.
                               // If the previous definition of x was in this
                               // same scope, this causes a redeclaration error.

   int f( /* nested scope begins here */ int k)
   {
       int k = k + 3; // redeclaration error of the name k
       ...
   }

   int f(int k)
   {
       {
           int k = k + 3; // 2nd k is parameter, initializing nested first k
           int m = k      // use of new k, which is hiding the parameter
       }
   }


For both for and while loops, the sub-statement itself does not introduce a new scope for variable names,
so the following has a redeclaration compile-time error:
   for ( /* nested scope begins here */ int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       int i; // redeclaration error
   }




                                               42
                                                                               4 Variables and Types




The body of a do-while loop introduces a new scope lasting only between the do and while (not including
the while test expression), whether or not the body is simple or compound:
   int i = 17;
   do
       int i = 4;          // okay, in nested scope
   while (i == 0);         // i is 17, scoped outside the do-while body

All variable names, structure type names, and function names in a given scope share the same name space.
Function names can be redeclared in the same scope, with the same or different parameters, without error.
An implicitly sized array can be redeclared in the same scope as an array of the same base type.
Otherwise, within one compilation unit, a declared name cannot be redeclared in the same scope; doing so
results in a redeclaration compile-time error. If a nested scope redeclares a name used in an outer scope,
it hides all existing uses of that name. There is no way to access the hidden name or make it unhidden,
without exiting the scope that hid it.
The built-in functions are scoped in a scope outside the global scope users declare global variables in.
That is, a shader's global scope, available for user-defined functions and global variables, is nested inside
the scope containing the built-in functions. When a function name is redeclared in a nested scope, it hides
all functions declared with that name in the outer scope. Function declarations (prototypes) cannot occur
inside of functions; they must be at global scope, or for the built-in functions, outside the global scope,
otherwise a compile-time error results.
Shared globals are global variables declared with the same name in independently compiled units
(shaders) within the same language (i.e., same stage, e.g., vertex) that are linked together when making a
single program. (Globals forming the interface between two different shader languages are discussed in
other sections.) Shared globals share the same name space, and must be declared with the same type.
They will share the same storage.
Shared global arrays must have the same base type and the same explicit size. An array implicitly sized in
one shader can be explicitly sized by another shader in the same stage. If no shader in a stage has an
explicit size for the array, the largest implicit size (one more than the largest index used) in that stage is
used. There is no cross-stage array sizing. If there is no static access to an implicitly sized array within
the stage declaring it, then the array is given a size of 1, which is relevant when the array is declared
within an interface block that is shared with other stages or the application (other unused arrays might be
eliminated by the optimizer).
Shared global scalars must have exactly the same type name and type definition. Structures must have the
same name, sequence of type names, and type definitions, and member names to be considered the same
type. This rule applies recursively for nested or embedded types. If a shared global has multiple
initializers, the initializers must all be constant expressions, and they must all have the same value.
Otherwise, a link-time error will result. (A shared global having only one initializer does not require that
initializer to be a constant expression.)

4.3   Storage Qualifiers
      Variable declarations may have at most one storage qualifier specified in front of the type. These are
      summarized as

             Storage Qualifier       Meaning
             < none: default >       local read/write memory, or an input parameter to a function
             const                   a variable whose value cannot be changed

             in                      linkage into a shader from a previous stage, variable is copied in


             out                     linkage out of a shader to a subsequent stage, variable is copied out


             attribute               compatibility profile only and vertex language only; same as in when in a
                                     vertex shader

             uniform                 value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms
                                     form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application

             varying                 compatibility profile only and vertex and fragment languages only; same
                                     as out when in a vertex shader and same as in when in a fragment shader


             buffer                  value is stored in a buffer object, and can be read or written both by
                                     shader invocations and the OpenGL API


             shared                  compute shader only; variable storage is shared across all work items in a
                                     local work group



      Some input and output qualified variables can be qualified with at most one additional auxiliary storage
      qualifier:

             Auxiliary Storage           Meaning
             Qualifier
             centroid                    centroid-based interpolation

             patch                       per-tessellation-patch attributes




                                                    44
                                                                                         4 Variables and Types




        Not all combinations of qualification are allowed. Which variable types can have which qualifiers are
        specifically defined in upcoming sections.
        Local variables can only use the const storage qualifier (or use no storage qualifier).
        Function parameters can use const, in, and out qualifiers, but as parameter qualifiers. Parameter
        qualifiers are discussed in section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.
        Function return types and structure members do not use storage qualifiers.
        Initializers in global declarations may only be used in declarations of global variables with no storage
        qualifier, with a const qualifier or with a uniform qualifier. Global variables without storage qualifiers
        that are not initialized in their declaration or by the application will not be initialized by OpenGL, but
        rather will enter main() with undefined values.
        When comparing an output from one shader stage to an input of a subsequent shader stage, the input and
        output don't match if their auxiliary qualifiers (or lack thereof) are not the same.

4.3.1   Default Storage Qualifier
        If no qualifier is present on a global variable, then the variable has no linkage to the application or shaders
        running on other pipeline stages. For either global or local unqualified variables, the declaration will
        appear to allocate memory associated with the processor it targets. This variable will provide read/write
        access to this allocated memory.

4.3.2   Constant Qualifier
        Named compile-time constants or read-only variables can be declared using the const qualifier. The const
        qualifier can be used with any of the non-void transparent basic data types, as well as with structures and
        arrays of these. It is a compile-time error to write to a const variable outside of its declaration, so they
        must be initialized when declared. For example,
            const vec3 zAxis = vec3 (0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
            const float ceiling = a + b; // a and b not necessarily constants

        Structure members may not be qualified with const. Structure variables can be declared as const, and
        initialized with a structure constructor or initializer.
        Initializers for const declarations at global scope must be constant expressions, as defined in section 4.3.3
        âConstant Expressions.â

4.3.3   Constant Expressions
        A constant expression is one of
        â¢   a literal value (e.g., 5 or true)
        â¢   a variable declared with the const qualifier and an initializer, where the initializer is a constant
            expression
        â¢   an expression formed by an operator on operands that are all constant expressions, including getting an
            element of a constant array, or a member of a constant structure, or components of a constant vector.




                                                         45
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



            However, the lowest precedence operators of the sequence operator ( , ) and the assignment operators
            ( =, +=, ...) are not included in the operators that can create a constant expression.
        â¢   valid use of the length() method on an explicitly sized object, whether or not the object itself is
            constant (implicitly sized or unsized arrays do not return a constant expression)
        â¢   a constructor whose arguments are all constant expressions
        â¢   the value returned by a built-in function call whose arguments are all constant expressions, with the
            exception of the texture lookup functions and the noise functions. This rule excludes functions with a
            void return or functions that have an out parameter. The built-in functions dFdx, dFdy, and fwidth
            must return 0 when evaluated with an argument that is a constant expression.
        Function calls to user-defined functions (non-built-in functions) cannot be used to form constant
        expressions.
        An integral constant expression is a constant expression that evaluates to a scalar signed or unsigned
        integer.
        Constant expressions will be always be evaluated in an invariant way, independent of use of invariant
        and precise qualification, so as to create the same value in multiple shaders when the same constant
        expressions appear in those shaders. See section 4.8.1 âThe Invariant Qualifierâ and section 4.9 âThe
        Precise Qualifierâ for more details on how to create invariant expressions. Constant expressions may be
        evaluated by the compiler's host platform, and are therefore not required to compute the same value that
        the same expression would evaluate to on the shader execution target. However, the host must use the
        same or greater precision than the target would use.

4.3.4   Input Variables
        Shader input variables are declared with the storage qualifier in. They form the input interface between
        previous stages of the OpenGL pipeline and the declaring shader. Input variables must be declared at
        global scope. Values from the previous pipeline stage are copied into input variables at the beginning of
        shader execution. It is a compile-time error to write to a variable declared as an input.
        Only the input variables that are statically read need to be written by the previous stage; it is allowed to
        have superfluous declarations of input variables. This is shown in the following table.

                                                                 Consuming Shader (input variables)

                                                                                4 Variables and Types



Consumption errors are based on static use only. Compilation may generate a warning, but not an error,
for any dynamic use the compiler can deduce that might cause consumption of undefined values.
See section 7 âBuilt-in Variablesâ for a list of the built-in input names.
Vertex shader input variables (or attributes) receive per-vertex data. They are declared in a vertex shader
with the in qualifier. It is a compile-time error to use any auxiliary or interpolation qualifier on a vertex
shader input. The values copied in are established by the OpenGL API or through the use of the layout
identifier location. It is a compile-time error to declare a vertex shader input containing any of the
following:
    â¢    A Boolean type (bool, bvec2, bvec3, bvec4)
    â¢    An opaque type
    â¢    A structure
Example declarations in a vertex shader:
   in vec4 position;
   in vec3 normal;
   in vec2 texCoord[4];

It is expected that graphics hardware will have a small number of fixed vector locations for passing vertex
inputs. Therefore, the OpenGL Shading language defines each non-matrix input variable as taking up one
such vector location. There is an implementation dependent limit on the number of locations that can be
used, and if this is exceeded it will cause a link-time error. (Declared input variables that are not statically
used do not count against this limit.) A scalar input counts the same amount against this limit as a vec4,
so applications may want to consider packing groups of four unrelated float inputs together into a vector
to better utilize the capabilities of the underlying hardware. A matrix input will use up multiple locations.
The number of locations used will equal the number of columns in the matrix.
Tessellation control, evaluation, and geometry shader input variables get the per-vertex values written out
by output variables of the same names in the previous active shader stage. For these inputs, centroid and
interpolation qualifiers are allowed, but have no effect. Since tessellation control, tessellation evaluation,
and geometry shaders operate on a set of vertices, each input variable (or input block, see interface blocks
below) needs to be declared as an array. For example,
   in float foo[];              // geometry shader input for vertex âout float fooâ

Each element of such an array corresponds to one vertex of the primitive being processed. Each array can
optionally have a size declared. For geometry shaders, the array size will be set by, (or if provided must
be consistent with) the input layout declaration(s) establishing the type of input primitive, as described
later in section 4.4.1 âInput Layout Qualifiersâ.
Some inputs and outputs are arrayed, meaning that for an interface between two shader stages either the
input or output declaration requires an extra level of array indexing for the declarations to match. For
example, with the interface between a vertex shader and a geometry shader, vertex shader output variables
and geometry shader input variables of the same name must have matching types, except that the
geometry shader will have one more array dimension than the vertex shader, to allow for vertex indexing.
If such an arrayed interface variable is not declared with the necessary additional input or output array
dimension, a link-time error will result. Geometry shader inputs, tessellation control shader inputs and




                                                 47
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



outputs, and tessellation evaluation inputs all have an additional level of arrayness relative to other shader
inputs and outputs.
For non-arrayed interfaces (meaning array dimensionally stays the same between stages), it is a link-time
error if the input variable is not declared with the same type, including array dimensionality, as the
matching output variable.
The link-time type-matching rules apply to all declared input and output variables, whether or not they are
used.
Additionally, tessellation evaluation shaders support per-patch input variables declared with the patch and
in qualifiers. Per-patch input variables are filled with the values of per-patch output variables written by
the tessellation control shader. Per-patch inputs may be declared as one-dimensional arrays, but are not
indexed by vertex number. Applying the patch qualifier to inputs can only be done in tessellation
evaluation shaders. As with other input variables, per-patch inputs must be declared using the same type
and qualification as per-patch outputs from the previous (tessellation control) shader stage.
Fragment shader inputs get per-fragment values, typically interpolated from a previous stage's outputs.
They are declared in fragment shaders with the in storage qualifier. The auxiliary storage qualifiers
centroid and sample can also be applied, as well as the interpolation qualifiers flat, noperspective, and
smooth. It is a compile-time error to use patch in a fragment shader. It is a compile-time error to
declare a fragment shader input containing any of the following:
    â¢    A Boolean type (bool, bvec2, bvec3, bvec4)
    â¢    An opaque type
Fragment shader inputs that are signed or unsigned integers, integer vectors, or any double-precision
floating-point type must be qualified with the interpolation qualifier flat.
Fragment inputs are declared as in the following examples:
   in vec3 normal;
   centroid in vec2 TexCoord;
   invariant centroid in vec4 Color;
   noperspective in float temperature;
   flat in vec3 myColor;
   noperspective centroid in vec2 myTexCoord;

The fragment shader inputs form an interface with the last active shader in the vertex processing pipeline.
For this interface, the last active shader stage output variables and fragment shader input variables of the
same name must match in type and qualification, with a few exceptions: The storage qualifiers must, of
course, differ (one is in and one is out). Also, interpolation qualification (e.g., flat) and auxiliary
qualification (e.g. centroid) may differ. These mismatches are allowed between any pair of stages. When
interpolation or auxiliary qualifiers do not match, those provided in the fragment shader supersede those
provided in previous stages. If any such qualifiers are completely missing in the fragment shaders, then
the default is used, rather than any qualifiers that may have been declared in previous stages. That is,
what matters is what is declared in the fragment shaders, not what is declared in shaders in previous
stages.
When an interface between shader stages is formed using shaders from two separate program objects, it is
not possible to detect mismatches between inputs and outputs when the programs are linked. When there




                                                48
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        are mismatches between inputs and outputs on such interfaces, the values passed across the interface will
        be partially or completely undefined. Shaders can ensure matches across such interfaces either by using
        input and output layout qualifiers (sections 4.4.1 âInput Layout Qualifiersâ and 4.4.2 âOutput Layout
        Qualifiersâ) or by using identical input and output declarations of blocks or variables. Complete rules for
        interface matching between programs are found in section 7.4.1 âShader Interface Matchingâ of the
        OpenGL Graphics System Specification.
        Compute shaders do not permit user-defined input variables and do not form a formal interface with any
        other shader stage. See section 7.1 âBuilt-In Variablesâ for a description of built-in compute shader input
        variables. All other input to a compute shader is retrieved explicitly through image loads, texture fetches,
        loads from uniforms or uniform buffers, or other user supplied code. Redeclaration of built-in input
        variables in compute shaders is not permitted.

4.3.5   Uniform Variables
        The uniform qualifier is used to declare global variables whose values are the same across the entire
        primitive being processed. All uniform variables are read-only and are initialized externally either at link
        time or through the API. The link-time initial value is either the value of the variable's initializer, if
        present, or 0 if no initializer is present. Opaque types cannot have initializers, or a compile-time error
        results.
        Example declarations are:
           uniform vec4 lightPosition;
           uniform vec3 color = vec3(0.7, 0.7, 0.2);                    // value assigned at link time

        The uniform qualifier can be used with any of the basic data types, or when declaring a variable whose
        type is a structure, or an array of any of these.
        There is an implementation dependent limit on the amount of storage for uniforms that can be used for
        each type of shader and if this is exceeded it will cause a compile-time or link-time error. Uniform
        variables that are declared but not used do not count against this limit. The number of user-defined
        uniform variables and the number of built-in uniform variables that are used within a shader are added
        together to determine whether available uniform storage has been exceeded.
        If multiple shaders are linked together, then they will share a single global uniform name space, including
        within a language as well as across languages. Hence, the types and initializers of all declared uniform
        variables with the same name must match across all shaders that are linked into a single program. While
        this single uniform name space is cross stage, a uniform variable name's scope is per stage: If a uniform
        variable name is declared in one stage (e.g., a vertex shader) but not in another (e.g., a fragment shader),
        then that name is still available in the other stage for a different use.
        It is legal for some shaders to provide an initializer for a particular uniform variable, while another shader
        does not, but all provided initializers must be equal. Similarly, when a layout location is used, it is not
        required that all declarations of that name include the location; only that those that include a location use
        the same location.

4.3.6   Output Variables
        Shader output variables are declared with a storage qualifier using the keyword out. They form the output
        interface between the declaring shader and the subsequent stages of the OpenGL pipeline. Output




                                                        49
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



variables must be declared at global scope. During shader execution they will behave as normal
unqualified global variables. Their values are copied out to the subsequent pipeline stage on shader exit.
Only output variables that are read by the subsequent pipeline stage need to be written; it is allowed to
have superfluous declarations of output variables.
There is not an inout storage qualifier at global scope for declaring a single variable name as both input
and output to a shader. Also, a variable cannot be declared with both the in and the out qualifiers, this
will result in a compile-time or link-time error. Output variables must be declared with different names
than input variables. However, nesting an input or output inside an interface block with an instance name
allows the same names with one referenced through a block instance name.
Vertex, tessellation evaluation, and geometry output variables output per-vertex data and are declared
using the out storage qualifier. Applying patch to an output can only be done in a tessellation control
shader.
It is a compile-time error to declare a vertex, tessellation evaluation, tessellation control, or geometry
shader output that contains any of the following:
    â¢    A Boolean type (bool, bvec2, bvec3, bvec4)
    â¢    An opaque type
Individual vertex, tessellation evaluation, and geometry outputs are declared as in the following examples:
   out vec3 normal;
   centroid out vec2 TexCoord;
   invariant centroid out vec4 Color;
   noperspective out float temperature;
   flat out vec3 myColor;
   noperspective centroid out vec2 myTexCoord;
   sample out vec4 perSampleColor;

These can also appear in interface blocks, as described in section 4.3.9 âInterface Blocksâ. Interface
blocks allow simpler addition of arrays to the interface from vertex to geometry shader. They also allow a
fragment shader to have the same input interface as a geometry shader for a given vertex shader.
Tessellation control shader output variables are may be used to output per-vertex and per-patch data. Per-
vertex output variables are arrayed (see arrayed under 4.3.4 Inputs) and declared using the out qualifier
without the patch qualifier. Per-patch output variables are declared using the patch and out qualifiers.
Since tessellation control shaders produce an arrayed primitive comprising multiple vertices, each per-
vertex output variable (or output block, see interface blocks below) needs to be declared as an array. For
example,
   out float foo[];          // feeds next stage input âin float foo[]â

Each element of such an array corresponds to one vertex of the primitive being produced. Each array can
optionally have a size declared. The array size will be set by (or if provided must be consistent with) the
output layout declaration(s) establishing the number of vertices in the output patch, as described later in
section 4.4.2.1 âTessellation Control Outputsâ.
Each tessellation control shader invocation has a corresponding output patch vertex, and may assign
values to per-vertex outputs only if they belong to that corresponding vertex. If a per-vertex output




                                                50
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



variable is used as an l-value, it is a compile-time error if the expression indicating the vertex index is not
the identifier gl_InvocationID.
The order of execution of a tessellation control shader invocation relative to the other invocations for the
same input patch is undefined unless the built-in function barrier() is used. This provides some control
over relative execution order. When a shader invocation calls barrier(), its execution pauses until all
other invocations have reached the same point of execution. Output variable assignments performed by
any invocation executed prior to calling barrier() will be visible to any other invocation after the call to
barrier() returns.
Because tessellation control shader invocations execute in undefined order between barriers, the values of
per-vertex or per-patch output variables will sometimes be undefined. Consider the beginning and end of
shader execution and each call to barrier() as synchronization points. The value of an output variable
will be undefined in any of the three following cases:
1. At the beginning of execution.
2. At each synchronization point, unless
        â¢ the value was well-defined after the previous synchronization point and was not written by any
          invocation since, or
     â¢    the value was written by exactly one shader invocation since the previous synchronization
          point, or
     â¢    the value was written by multiple shader invocations since the previous synchronization point,
          and the last write performed by all such invocations wrote the same value.
3. When read by a shader invocation, if
        â¢     the value was undefined at the previous synchronization point and has not been writen by the
              same shader invocation since, or
        â¢     the output variable is written to by any other shader invocation between the previous and next
              synchronization points, even if that assignment occurs in code following the read.

Fragment outputs output per-fragment data and are declared using the out storage qualifier. It is a
compile-time error to use auxiliary storage qualifiers or interpolation qualifiers on an output in a fragment
shader. It is a compile-time error to declare a fragment shader output that contains any of the following:
    â¢       A Boolean type (bool, bvec2, bvec3, bvec4)
    â¢       A double-precision scalar or vector (double, dvec2, dvec3, dvec4)
    â¢       An opaque type
    â¢       Any matrix type
    â¢       A structure
Fragment outputs are declared as in the following examples:
   out vec4 FragmentColor;
   out uint Luminosity;


Compute shaders have no built-in output variables, do not support user-defined output variables and do
not form a formal interface with any other shader stage. All outputs from a compute shader take the form
of the side effects such as image stores and operations on atomic counters.




                                                51
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



4.3.7   Buffer Variables
        The buffer qualifier is used to declare global variables whose values are stored in the data store of a
        buffer object bound through the OpenGL API. Buffer variables can be read and written with the
        underlying storage shared among all active shader invocations. Buffer variable memory reads and writes
        within a single shader invocation are processed in order. However, the order of reads and writes
        performed in one invocation relative to those performed by another invocation is largely undefined.
        Buffer variables may be qualified with memory qualifiers affecting how the underlying memory is
        accessed, as described in section 4.10 âMemory Qualifiersâ.
        The buffer qualifier can be used with any of the basic data types, or when declaring a variable whose type
        is a structure, or an array of any of these.
        Buffer variables may only be declared inside interface blocks (section 4.3.9 âInterface Blocksâ), which
        are then referred to as shader storage blocks. It is a compile-time error to declare buffer variables at
        global scope (outside a block). Buffer variables cannot have initializers.
           // use buffer to create a buffer block (shader storage block)
           buffer BufferName {   // externally visible name of buffer
               int count;        // typed, shared memory...
               ...               // ...
               vec4 v[];         // last element may be an array that is not sized
                                 //      until after link time (dynamically sized)
           } Name;               // name of block within the shader

        There are implementation-dependent limits on the number of shader storage blocks used for each type of
        shader, the combined number of shader storage blocks used for a program, and the amount of storage
        required by each individual shader storage block. If any of these limits are exceeded, it will cause a
        compile-time or link-time error.
        If multiple shaders are linked together, then they will share a single global buffer variable name space,
        including within a language as well as across languages. Hence, the types of all declared buffer variables
        with the same name must match across all shaders that are linked into a single program.

4.3.8   Shared Variables
        The shared qualifier is used to declare variables that have storage shared between all work items
        compute shader local work group. Variables declared as shared may only be used in compute shaders
        (see section 2.6 âCompute Processorâ). Shared variables are implicitly coherent. That is, writes to shared
        variables from one shader invocation will eventually be seen by other invocations within the same local
        work group.
        Variables declared as shared may not have initializers and their contents are undefined at the beginning
        of shader execution. Any data written to shared variables will be visible to other shaders executing the
        same shader within the same local work group. Order of execution with respect to reads and writes to the
        same shared variable by different invocations of a shader is not defined. In order to achieve ordering with
        respect to reads and writes to shared variables, memory barriers must be employed using the barrier()
        function (see section 8.16 âShader Invocation Control Functionsâ).




                                                      52
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



        There is a limit to the total size of all variables declared as shared in a single program. This limit,
        expressed in units of basic machine units may be determined by using the OpenGL API to query the value
        of MAX_COMPUTE_SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE.

4.3.9   Interface Blocks
        Input, output, uniform, and buffer variable declarations can be grouped into named interface blocks to
        provide coarser granularity backing than is achievable with individual declarations. They can have an
        optional instance name, used in the shader to reference their members. An output block of one
        programmable stage is backed by a corresponding input block in the subsequent programmable stage. A
        uniform block is backed by the application with a buffer object. A block of buffer variables, called a
        shader storage block, is also backed by the application with a buffer object. It is a compile-time error to
        have an input block in a vertex shader or an output block in a fragment shader; these uses are reserved for
        future use.
        An interface block is started by an in, out, uniform, or buffer keyword, followed by a block name,
        followed by an open curly brace ( { ) as follows:
             interface-block :
                   layout-qualifieropt interface-qualifier block-name { member-list } instance-nameopt ;
             interface-qualifier :
                   in
                   out
                   uniform
                   buffer
             member-list :
                 member-declaration
                 member-declaration member-list
             member-declaration :
                 layout-qualifieropt qualifiersopt type declarators ;
             instance-name :
                   identifier
                   identifier [ ]
                   identifier [ integral-constant-expression ]
        Each of the above elements is discussed below, with the exception of layout qualifiers (layout-qualifier),
        which are defined in the next section.
        First, an example,
           uniform Transform {
               mat4 ModelViewMatrix;
               mat4 ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
               uniform mat3 NormalMatrix;                        // allowed restatement of qualifier
               float Deformation;
           };

        The above establishes a uniform block named âTransformâ with four uniforms grouped inside it.




                                                       53
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



Types and declarators are the same as for other input, output, uniform, and buffer variable declarations
outside blocks, with these exceptions:
â¢   initializers are not allowed
â¢   opaque types are not allowed
â¢   structure definitions cannot be nested inside a block
Any of these would result in a compile-time error. Otherwise, built-in types, previously declared
structures, and arrays of these are allowed as the type of a declarator in the same manner they are allowed
outside a block.
If no optional qualifier is used in a member-declaration, the qualification of the variable is just in, out,
uniform, or buffer as determined by interface-qualifier. If optional qualifiers are used, they can include
interpolation qualifiers, auxiliary storage qualifiers, and storage qualifiers and they must declare an input,
output, or uniform variable consistent with the interface qualifier of the block: Input variables, output
variables, uniform variables, and buffer variables can only be in in blocks, out blocks, uniform blocks,
and shader storage blocks, respectively. Repeating the in, out, uniform, or buffer interface qualifier for
a member's storage qualifier is optional. For example,
    in Material {
        smooth in vec4 Color1;           //   legal, input inside in block
        smooth vec4 Color2;              //   legal, 'in' inherited from 'in Material'
        vec2 TexCoord;                   //   legal, TexCoord is an input
        uniform float Atten;             //   illegal, mismatched storage qualifier

    };

For this section, define an interface to be one of these
â¢   All the uniform variables and uniform blocks declared in a program. This spans all compilation units
    linked together within one program.
â¢   All the buffer blocks declared in a program.
â¢   The boundary between adjacent programmable pipeline stages: This spans all the outputs declared in
    all compilation units of the first stage and all the inputs declared in all compilation units of the second
    stage.
The block name (block-name) is used to match interfaces: an output block of one pipeline stage will be
matched to an input block with the same name in the subsequent pipeline stage. For uniform blocks, the
application uses the block name to identify the block. Block names have no other use within a shader
beyond interface matching; it is a compile-time error to use a block name at global scope for anything
other than as a block name (e.g., use of a block name for a global variable name or function name is
currently reserved). It is a compile-time error to use the same block name for more than one block
declaration in the same interface (as defined above) within one shader, even if the block contents are
identical.
Matched block names within an interface (as defined above) must match in terms of having the same
number of declarations with the same sequence of types and the same sequence of member names, as well
as having the same member-wise layout qualification (see next section). Matched uniform block names
(but not input or output block names) must also either all be lacking an instance name or all having an

instance name, putting their members at the same scoping level. When instance names are present on
matched block names, it is allowed for the instance names to differ; they need not match for the blocks to
match. Furthermore, if a matching block is declared as an array, then the array sizes must also match (or
follow array matching rules for the interface between a vertex and a geometry shader). Any mismatch
will generate a link-time error. A block name is allowed to have different definitions in different
interfaces within the same shader, allowing, for example, an input block and output block to have the
same name.
If an instance name (instance-name) is not used, the names declared inside the block are scoped at the
global level and accessed as if they were declared outside the block. If an instance name (instance-name)
is used, then it puts all the members inside a scope within its own name space, accessed with the field
selector ( . ) operator (analogously to structures). For example,
   in Light {
       vec4 LightPos;
       vec3 LightColor;
   };
   in ColoredTexture {
       vec4 Color;
       vec2 TexCoord;
   } Material;                     // instance name
   vec3 Color;                     // different Color than Material.Color
   vec4 LightPos;                  // illegal, already defined
   ...
   ... = LightPos;                 // accessing LightPos
   ... = Material.Color;           // accessing Color in ColoredTexture block

Outside the shading language (i.e., in the API), members are similarly identified except the block name is
always used in place of the instance name (API accesses are to interfaces, not to shaders). If there is no
instance name, then the API does not use the block name to access a member, just the member name.
Within an interface, all declarations of the same global name must be for the same object and must match
in type and in whether they declare a variable or member of a block with no instance name. The API also
needs this name to uniquely identify an object in the interface. It is a link-time error if any particular
interface contains
     â¢    two different blocks, each having no instance name, and each having a member of the same
          name, or
     â¢    a variable outside a block, and a block with no instance name, where the variable has the same
          name as a member in the block.

   out Vertex {
       vec4 Position;          // API transform/feedback will use âVertex.Positionâ

       vec4 Color;      // ERROR, name collision with Color in Vertex2
   };
   float Color2;        // ERROR, collides with Color2 in Vertex2

For blocks declared as arrays, the array index must also be included when accessing members, as in this
example
   uniform Transform { // API uses âTransform[2]â to refer to instance 2
       mat4           ModelViewMatrix;
       mat4           ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
       vec4           a[]; // array will get implicitly sized
       float          Deformation;
   } transforms[4];
   ...
   ... = transforms[2].ModelViewMatrix; // shader access of instance 2
   // API uses âTransform.ModelViewMatrixâ to query an offset or other query
   transforms[x].a.length(); // same length for 'a' for all x
   Transform[x];             // illegal, must use 'transforms'
   Transform.a.length();     // illegal, must use 'transforms'
   ...transforms[2].a[3]... // if these are the only two dereferences of 'a',
   ...transforms[3].a[7]... // then 'a' must be size 8, for all transforms[x]


For uniform or shader storage blocks declared as an array, each individual array element corresponds to a
separate buffer-object bind range, backing one instance of the block. As the array size indicates the
number of buffer objects needed, uniform and shader storage block array declarations must specify an
array size. A uniform or shader storage block array can only be indexed with a dynamically uniform
integral expression, otherwise results are undefined.
When using OpenGL API entry points to identify the name of an individual block in an array of blocks,
the name string must include an array index (e.g., Transform[2]). When using OpenGL API entry points
to refer to offsets or other characteristics of a block member, an array index must not be specified (e.g.,
Transform.ModelViewMatrix).
Geometry shader input blocks must be declared as arrays and follow the array declaration and linking
rules for all geometry shader inputs. All other input and output block arrays must specify an array size.

      There are implementation dependent limits on the number of uniform blocks and the number of shader
      storage blocks that can be used per stage. If either limit is exceeded, it will cause a link-time error.

4.4   Layout Qualifiers
      Layout qualifiers can appear in several forms of declaration. They can appear as part of an interface
      block definition or block member, as shown in the grammar in the previous section. They can also appear
      with just an interface qualifier (a storage qualifier that is in, out, or uniform) to establish layouts of other
      declarations made with that interface qualifier:
           layout-qualifier interface-qualifier ;
      Or, they can appear with an individual variable declared with an interface qualifier:
           layout-qualifier interface-qualifier declaration ;
      Declarations of layouts can only be made at global scope, and only where indicated in the following
      subsections; their details are specific to what the interface qualifier is, and are discussed individually.
      The layout-qualifier expands to
           layout-qualifier :
                layout ( layout-qualifier-id-list )
           layout-qualifier-id-list :
                layout-qualifier-id
                layout-qualifier-id , layout-qualifier-id-list
           layout-qualifier-id
                layout-qualifier-name
                layout-qualifier-name = layout-qualifier-value
                shared
      The tokens used for layout-qualifier-name are identifiers, not keywords, however, the shared keyword is
      allowed as a layout-qualifier-id. Generally, they can be listed in any order. Order-dependent meanings
      exist only if explicitly called out below. Similarly, these identifiers are not case sensitive, unless
      explicitly noted otherwise.
      More than one layout qualifier may appear in a single declaration. Additionally, the same layout-
      qualifier-name can occur multiple times within a layout qualifier or across multiple layout qualifiers in the
      same declaration. When the same layout-qualifier-name occurs multiple times, in a single declaration, the
      last occurrence overrides the former occurrence(s). Further, if such a layout-qualifier-name will effect
      subsequent declarations or other observable behavior, it is only the last occurrence that will have any
      effect, behaving as if the earlier occurrence(s) within the declaration are not present. This is also true for
      overriding layout-qualifier-names, where one overrides the other (e.g., row_major vs. column_major);
      only the last occurrence has any effect.
      The following table summarizes the use of layout qualifiers applied to non-opaque types. It shows for
      each one what kinds of declarations it may be applied to. These are all discussed in detail in the following
      sections. Layout qualifiers applied to opaque types are not show in this table, but are discussed
      subsequently in section 4.4.6 âOpaque-Uniform Layout Qualifiersâ.

4.4.1   Input Layout Qualifiers
        Some input layout qualifiers apply to all shader languages and some apply only to specific languages.
        The latter are discussed in separate sections below.
        All shaders, except compute shaders, allow location layout qualifiers on input variable declarations, input
        block declarations, and input block member declarations. Of these, variables and block members (but not
        blocks) additionally allow the component layout qualifier.
        The layout qualifier identifiers for inputs are:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  location = integer-constant-expression
                  component = integer-constant-expression
        Where integral-constant-expression is defined in section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ as âintegral
        constant expressionâ.
        For example,
           layout(location = 3) in vec4 normal;
           const int start = 6;
           layout(location = start + 2) int vec4 v;

        will establish that the shader input normal is assigned to vector location number 3 and v is assigned
        location number 8. For vertex shader inputs, the location specifies the number of the generic vertex




                                                           59
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



attribute from which input values are taken. For inputs of all other shader types, the location specifies a
vector number that can be used to match against outputs from a previous shader stage, even if that shader
is in a different program object.
The following language describes how many locations are consumed by a given type. However, geometry
shader inputs, tessellation control shader inputs and outputs, and tessellation evaluation inputs all have an
additional level of arrayness relative to other shader inputs and outputs. This outer array level is removed
from the type before considering how many locations the type consumes.
If a vertex shader input is any scalar or vector type, it will consume a single location. If a non-vertex
shader input is a scalar or vector type other than dvec3 or dvec4, it will consume a single location, while
types dvec3 or dvec4 will consume two consecutive locations. Inputs of type double and dvec2 will
consume only a single location, in all stages.
If the declared input (after potentially removing an outer array level as just described above) is an array of
size n and each element takes m locations, it will be assigned m * n consecutive locations starting with the
location specified. For example,
   layout(location = 6) in vec4 colors[3];

will establish that the shader input colors is assigned to vector location numbers 6, 7, and 8.
If the declared input is an n x m single- or double-precision matrix, it will be assigned multiple locations
starting with the location specified. The number of locations assigned for each matrix will be the same as
for an n-element array of m-component vectors. For example,
   layout(location = 9) in mat4 transforms[2];

will establish that shader input transforms is assigned to vector locations 9-16, with transforms[0] being
assigned to locations 9-12 and transforms[1] being assigned to locations 13-16.
If the declared input is a structure or block, its members will be assigned consecutive locations in their
order of declaration, with the first member assigned the location provided in the layout qualifier. For a
structure, this process applies to the entire structure. It is a compile-time error to use a location qualifier
on a member of a structure. For a block, this process applies to the entire block, or until the first member
is reached that has a location layout qualifier. When a block member is declared with a location
qualifier, its location comes from that qualifier: The member's location qualifier overrides the block-level
declaration. Subsequent members are again assigned consecutive locations, based on the newest location,
until the next member declared with a location qualifier. The values used for locations do not have to be
declared in increasing order.
If a block has no block-level location layout qualifier, it is required that either all or none of its members
have a location layout qualifier, or a compile-time error results.
The locations consumed by block and structure members are determined by applying the rules above
recursively as though the structure member were declared as an input variable of the same type. For
example:




                                                60
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



   layout(location = 3) in struct S {
        vec3 a;                       //                  gets location 3
        mat2 b;                       //                  gets locations 4 and 5
        vec4 c[2];                    //                  gets locations 6 and 7
        layout (location = 8) vec2 A; //                  ERROR, can't use on struct member
   } s;

   layout(location = 4) in block {
       vec4 d;                                       //   gets location 4
       vec4 e;                                       //   gets location 5
       layout(location = 7) vec4 f;                  //   gets location 7
       vec4 g;                                       //   gets location 8
       layout (location = 1) vec4 h;                 //   gets location 1
       vec4 i;                                       //   gets location 2
       vec4 j;                                       //   gets location 3
       vec4 k;                                       //   ERROR, location 4 already used
   };

The number of input locations available to a shader is limited. For vertex shaders, the limit is the
advertised number of vertex attributes. For all other shaders, the limit is implementation-dependent and
must be no less than one fourth of the advertised maximum input component count. A program will fail to
link if any attached shader uses a location greater than or equal to the number of supported locations,
unless device-dependent optimizations are able to make the program fit within available hardware
resources.
A program will fail to link if explicit location assignments leave the linker unable to find space for other
variables without explicit assignments.
For the purposes of determining if a non-vertex input matches an output from a previous shader stage, the
location layout qualifier (if any) must match.
If a vertex shader input variable with no location assigned in the shader text has a location specified
through the OpenGL API, the API-assigned location will be used. Otherwise, such variables will be
assigned a location by the linker. See section 11.1.1 âVertex Attributesâ of the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification for more details. A link-time error will occur if an input variable is declared in multiple
shaders of the same language with conflicting locations.
The component qualifier allows the location to be more finely specified for scalars and vectors, down to
the individual components within a location that are consumed. It is a compile-time error to use
component without also specifying the location qualifier (order does not matter). The components
within a location are 0, 1, 2, and 3. A variable or block member starting at component N will consume
components N, N+1, N+2, ... up through its size. It is a compile-time error if this sequence of components
gets larger than 3. For example:




                                                61
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



          // a consumes components 2 and 3 of location 4
          layout(location = 4, component = 2) in vec2 a;

          // b consumes component 1 of location 4
          layout(location = 4, component = 1) in float b;

          // ERROR: c overflows components 2 and 3
          layout(location = 3, component = 2) in vec3 c;

       If the variable is an array, each element of the array, in order, is assigned to consecutive locations, but all
       at the same specified component within each location. For example:
          // component 3 in 6 locations are consumed
          layout(location = 2, component = 3) in float d[6];

       That is, location 2 component 3 will hold d[0], location 3 component 3 will hold d[1], â¦, up through
       location 7 component 3 holding d[5].
       This allows packing of two arrays into the same set of locations:
          // e consumes beginning (components 0, 1 and 2) of each of 6 slots
          layout(location = 0, component = 0) in vec3 e[6];

          // f consumes last component of the same 6 slots
          layout(location = 0, component = 3) in float f[6];

       If applying this to an array of arrays, all levels of arrayness are removed to get to the elements that are
       assigned per location to the specified component. These non-arrayed elements will fill the locations in the
       order specified for arrays of arrays in section 4.1.9 "Arrays".
       It is a compile-time error to apply the component qualifier to a matrix, a structure, a block, or an array
       containing any of these. It is a link-time error to specify different components for the same variable
       within a program.
       Location aliasing is causing two variables or block members to have the same location number.
       Component aliasing is assigning the same (or overlapping) component numbers for two location aliases.
       (Recall if component is not used, component's are assigned starting with 0.) With one exception, location
       aliasing is allowed only if it does not cause component aliasing; it is a compile-time or link-time error to
       cause component aliasing. Further, when location aliasing, the aliases sharing the location must have the
       same underlying numerical type (floating-point or integer) and the same auxiliary storage and
       interpolation qualification. The one exception where component aliasing is permitted is for two input
       variables (not block members) to a vertex shader, which are allowed to have component aliasing. This
       vertex-variable component aliasing is intended only to support vertex shaders where each execution path
       accesses at most one input per each aliased component. Implementations are permitted, but not required,
       to generate link-time errors if they detect that every path through the vertex shader executable accesses
       multiple inputs aliased to any single component.

4.4.1.1 Tessellation Evaluation Inputs
       Additional input layout qualifier identifiers allowed for tessellation evaluation shaders are:




                                                        62
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



     layout-qualifier-id
          triangles
          quads
          isolines
          equal_spacing
          fractional_even_spacing
          fractional_odd_spacing
          cw
          ccw
          point_mode


One subset of these identifiers, primitive mode, is used to specify a tessellation primitive mode to be used
by the tessellation primitive generator. To specify a primitive mode, the identifier must be one of
triangles, quads, or isolines, which specify that the tessellation primitive generator should subdivide a
triangle into smaller triangles, a quad into triangles, or a quad into a collection of lines, respectively.
A second subset of these identifiers, vertex spacing, is used to specify the spacing used by the tessellation
primitive generator when subdividing an edge. To specify vertex spacing, the identifier must be one of
the following.
       equal_spacing signifying that edges should be divided into a collection of equal-sized segments.
       fractional_even_spacing signifying that edges should be divided into an even number of equal-
       length segments plus two additional shorter "fractional" segments.
       fractional_odd_spacing signifying that edges should be divided into an odd number of equal-
       length segments plus two additional shorter "fractional" segments.
A third subset of these identifiers, ordering, specifies whether the tessellation primitive generator
produces triangles in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, according to the coordinate system depicted
in the OpenGL specification. The ordering identifiers cw and ccw indicate clockwise and counter-
clockwise triangles, respectively. If the tessellation primitive generator does not produce triangles,
ordering is ignored.
Finally, point mode, is specified with the identifier point_mode indicating the tessellation primitive
generator should produce a point for each unique vertex in the subdivided primitive, rather than
generating lines or triangles.
Any or all of these identifiers may be specified one or more times in a single input layout declaration. If
primitive mode, vertex spacing, or ordering is declared more than once in the tessellation evaluation
shaders of a program, all such declarations must use the same identifier.
At least one tessellation evaluation shader (compilation unit) in a program must declare a primitive mode
in its input layout. Declaring vertex spacing, ordering, or point mode identifiers is optional. It is not
required that all tessellation evaluation shaders in a program declare a primitive mode. If spacing or
vertex ordering declarations are omitted, the tessellation primitive generator will use equal spacing or
counter-clockwise vertex ordering, respectively. If a point mode declaration is omitted, the tessellation
primitive generator will produce lines or triangles according to the primitive mode.




                                                63
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



4.4.1.2 Geometry Shader Inputs
       Additional layout qualifier identifiers for geometry shader inputs include primitive identifiers and an
       invocation count identifier:
            layout-qualifier-id
                 points
                 lines
                 lines_adjacency
                 triangles
                 triangles_adjacency
                 invocations = integer-constant-expression
       The identifiers points, lines, lines_adjacency, triangles, and triangles_adjacency are used to specify the
       type of input primitive accepted by the geometry shader, and only one of these is accepted. At least one
       geometry shader (compilation unit) in a program must declare this input primitive layout, and all geometry
       shader input layout declarations in a program must declare the same layout. It is not required that all
       geometry shaders in a program declare an input primitive layout.
       The identifier invocations is used to specify the number of times the geometry shader executable is
       invoked for each input primitive received. Invocation count declarations are optional. If no invocation
       count is declared in any geometry shader in a program, the geometry shader will be run once for each
       input primitive. If an invocation count is declared, all such declarations must specify the same count. If a
       shader specifies an invocation count greater than the implementation-dependent maximum, it will fail to
       compile.
       For example,
          layout(triangles, invocations = 6) in;

       will establish that all inputs to the geometry shader are triangles and that the geometry shader executable
       is run six times for each triangle processed.
       All geometry shader input unsized array declarations will be sized by an earlier input primitive layout
       qualifier, when present, as per the following table.


                          Layout                 Size of Input Arrays
              points                                       1
              lines                                        2
              lines_adjacency                              4
              triangles                                    3
              triangles_adjacency                          6




                                                      64
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



       The intrinsically declared input array gl_in[] will also be sized by any input primitive-layout declaration.
       Hence, the expression
          gl_in.length()

       will return the value from the table above.
       For inputs declared without an array size, including intrinsically declared inputs (i.e., gl_in), a layout must
       be declared before any use of the method length or other any array use that requires the array size to be
       known.
       It is a compile-time error if a layout declaration's array size (from table above) does not match all the
       explicit array sizes specified in declarations of an input variables in the same shader. The following
       includes examples of compile-time errors:
          // code sequence within            one shader...
          in vec4 Color1[];    //            legal, size still unknown
          in vec4 Color2[2];   //            legal, size is 2
          in vec4 Color3[3];   //            illegal, input sizes are inconsistent
          layout(lines) in;    //            legal for Color2, input size is 2, matching Color2
          in vec4 Color4[3];   //            illegal, contradicts layout of lines
          layout(lines) in;    //            legal, matches other layout() declaration
          layout(triangles) in;//            illegal, does not match earlier layout() declaration

       It is a link-time error if not all provided sizes (sized input arrays and layout size) match across all
       geometry shaders in a program.

4.4.1.3 Fragment Shader Inputs
       Additional fragment layout qualifier identifiers include the following for gl_FragCoord
            layout-qualifier-id
                 origin_upper_left
                 pixel_center_integer
       By default, gl_FragCoord assumes a lower-left origin for window coordinates and assumes pixel centers
       are located at half-pixel coordinates. For example, the (x, y) location (0.5, 0.5) is returned for the lower-
       left-most pixel in a window. The origin can be changed by redeclaring gl_FragCoord with the
       origin_upper_left identifier, moving the origin of gl_FragCoord to the upper left of the window, with y
       increasing in value toward the bottom of the window. The values returned can also be shifted by half a
       pixel in both x and y by pixel_center_integer so it appears the pixels are centered at whole number pixel
       offsets. This moves the (x, y) value returned by gl_FragCoord of (0.5, 0.5) by default, to (0.0, 0.0) with
       pixel_center_integer.




                                                        65
                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



       Redeclarations are done as follows
          in vec4 gl_FragCoord;               // redeclaration that changes nothing is allowed

          // All the following are allowed redeclaration that change behavior
          layout(origin_upper_left) in vec4 gl_FragCoord;
          layout(pixel_center_integer) in vec4 gl_FragCoord;
          layout(origin_upper_left, pixel_center_integer) in vec4 gl_FragCoord;

       If gl_FragCoord is redeclared in any fragment shader in a program, it must be redeclared in all the
       fragment shaders in that program that have a static use gl_FragCoord. All redeclarations of
       gl_FragCoord in all fragment shaders in a single program must have the same set of qualifiers. Within
       any shader, the first redeclarations of gl_FragCoord must appear before any use of gl_FragCoord. The
       built-in gl_FragCoord is only predeclared in fragment shaders, so redeclaring it in any other shader
       language results in a compile-time error.
       Redeclaring gl_FragCoord with origin_upper_left and/or pixel_center_integer qualifiers only affects
       gl_FragCoord.x and gl_FragCoord.y. It has no affect on rasterization, transformation, or any other part
       of the OpenGL pipeline or language features.
       Fragment shaders also allow the following layout qualifier on in only (not with variable declarations)
            layout-qualifier-id
                 early_fragment_tests
       to request that fragment tests be performed before fragment shader execution, as described in section
       15.2.4 âEarly Fragment Testsâ of the OpenGL Specification.
       For example,
          layout(early_fragment_tests) in;


       Specifying this will make per-fragment tests be performed before fragment shader execution. If this is not
       declared, per-fragment tests will be performed after fragment shader execution. Only one fragment shader
       (compilation unit) need declare this, though more than one can. If at least one declares this, then it is
       enabled.

4.4.1.4 Compute Shader Inputs
       There are no layout location qualifiers for compute shader inputs.
       Layout qualifier identifiers for compute shader inputs are the work-group size qualifiers:
            layout-qualifier-id
                 local_size_x = integer-constant-expression
                 local_size_y = integer-constant-expression
                 local_size_z = integer-constant-expression
       The local_size_x, local_size_y, and local_size_z qualifiers are used to declare a fixed local group size by
       the compute shader in the first, second, and third dimension, respectively. The default size in each
       dimension is 1. If a shader does not specify a size for one of the dimensions, that dimension will have a
       size of 1.




                                                      66
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



        For example, the following declaration in a compute shader
           layout (local_size_x = 32, local_size_y = 32) in;

        is used to declare a two-dimensional compute shader with a local size of 32 X 32 elements, which is
        equivalent to a three-dimensional compute shader where the third dimension has size one.
        As another example, the declaration
           layout (local_size_x = 8) in;

        effectively specifies that a one-dimensional compute shader is being compiled, and its size is 8 elements.
        If the fixed local group size of the shader in any dimension is greater than the maximum size supported by
        the implementation for that dimension, a compile-time error results. Also, if such a layout qualifier is
        declared more than once in the same shader, all those declarations must set the same set of local work-
        group sizes and set them to the same values; otherwise a compile-time error results. If multiple compute
        shaders attached to a single program object declare a fixed local group size, the declarations must be
        identical; otherwise a link-time error results.
        Furthermore, if a program object contains any compute shaders, at least one must contain an input layout
        qualifier specifying a fixed local group size for the program, or a link-time error will occur.

4.4.2   Output Layout Qualifiers
        Some output layout qualifiers apply to all shader languages and some apply only to specific languages.
        The latter are discussed in separate sections below.
        As with input layout qualifiers, all shaders except compute shaders allow location layout qualifiers
        on output variable declarations, output block declarations, and output block member declarations. Of
        these, variables and block members (but not blocks) additionally allow the component layout qualifier.
        The layout qualifier identifiers for outputs are:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  location = integer-constant-expression
                  component = integer-constant-expression
        The usage and rules for using the component qualifier, and applying location qualifier to blocks and
        structures, are exactly as described in section 4.4.1 "Input Layout Qualifiers". Additionally, for fragment
        shader outputs, if two variables are placed within the same location, they must have the same underlying
        type (floating-point or integer). No component aliasing of output variables or members is allowed.
        Fragment shaders allow an additional index output layout qualifiers:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  index = integer-constant-expression
        Each of these qualifiers may appear at most once. If index is specified, location must also be specified.
        If index is not specified, the value 0 is used. For example, in a fragment shader,




                                                            67
                                                                                 4 Variables and Types



   layout(location = 3) out vec4 color;

will establish that the fragment shader output color is assigned to fragment color 3 as the first (index zero)
input to the blend equation. And,
   layout(location = 3, index = 1) out vec4 factor;

will establish that the fragment shader output factor is assigned to fragment color 3 as the second (index
one) input to the blend equation.
For fragment-shader outputs, the location and index specify the color output number and index receiving
the values of the output. For outputs of all other shader stages, the location specifies a vector number that
can be used to match against inputs in a subsequent shader stage, even if that shader is in a different
program object.
If a declared output is a scalar or vector type other than dvec3 or dvec4, it will consume a single location.
Outputs of type dvec3 or dvec4 will consume two consecutive locations. Outputs of type double and
dvec2 will consume only a single location, in all stages.
If the declared output is an array, it will be assigned consecutive locations starting with the location
specified. For example,
   layout(location = 2) out vec4 colors[3];

will establish that colors is assigned to vector location numbers 2, 3, and 4.
If the declared output is an n x m single- or double-precision matrix, it will be assigned multiple locations
starting with the location specified. The number of locations assigned will be the same as for an n-
element array of m-component vectors.
If the declared output is a structure, its members will be assigned consecutive locations in the order of
declaration, with the first member assigned the location specified for the structure. The number of
locations consumed by a structure member is determined by applying the rules above recursively as
though the structure member were declared as an output variable of the same type.
Location layout qualifiers may be used on output variables declared as structures, but not on individual
members. Location layout qualifiers may not be used on output blocks or output block members.
Compile-time errors result if these rules are not followed.
The number of output locations available to a shader is limited. For fragment shaders, the limit is the
advertised number of draw buffers. For all other shaders, the limit is implementation-dependent and must
be no less than one fourth of the advertised maximum output component count. (Compute shaders have
no outputs.) A program will fail to link if any attached shader uses a location greater than or equal to the
number of supported locations, unless device-dependent optimizations are able to make the program fit
within available hardware resources. Compile-time errors may also be given if at compile time it is
known the link will fail. A negative output location will result in a compile-time error. It is also a
compile-time error if a fragment shader sets a layout index to less than 0 or greater than 1.
A program will fail to link if any of the following occur:
    â¢    any two fragment shader output variables are assigned to the same location and index, or
    â¢    any two geometry shader output variables are assigned the same location and stream, or




                                                68
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



           â¢      if any two output variables from the same vertex or tessellation shader stage are assigned to the
                  same location.
       For fragment shader outputs, locations can be assigned using either a layout qualifier or via the OpenGL
       API. For all shader types, a program will fail to link if explicit location assignments leave the linker
       unable to find space for other variables without explicit assignments.
       If an output variable with no location or index assigned in the shader text has a location specified through
       the OpenGL API, the API-assigned location will be used. Otherwise, such variables will be assigned a
       location by the linker. All such assignments will have a color index of zero. See section 15.2 âShader
       Executionâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification for more details. A link-time error will occur if
       an output variable is declared in multiple shaders of the same language with conflicting location or index
       values.
       For the purposes of determining if a non-fragment output matches an input from a subsequent shader
       stage, the location layout qualifier (if any) must match.

4.4.2.1 Transform Feedback Layout Qualifiers
       The vertex, tessellation, and geometry stages allow shaders to control transform feedback. When doing
       this, shaders will dictate which transform feedback buffers are in use, which output variables will be
       written to which buffers, and how each buffer is laid out. To accomplish this, shaders allow the following
       layout qualifier identifiers on output declarations:
               layout-qualifier-id
                    xfb_buffer = integer-constant-expression
                    xfb_offset = integer-constant-expression
                    xfb_stride = integer-constant-expression
       Any shader making any static use (after preprocessing) of any of these xfb_ qualifiers will cause the
       shader to be in a transform feedback capturing mode and hence responsible for describing the transform
       feedback setup. This mode will capture any output selected by xfb_offset, directly or indirectly, to a
       transform feedback buffer.
       The xfb_buffer qualifier specifies which transform feedback buffer will capture outputs selected with
       xfb_offset. The xfb_buffer qualifier can be applied to the qualifier out, to output variables, to output
       blocks, and to output block members. Shaders in the transform feedback capturing mode have an initial
       global default of
          layout(xfb_buffer = 0) out;

       This default can be changed by declaring a different buffer with xfb_buffer on the interface qualifier out.
       This is the only way the global default can be changed. When a variable or output block is declared
       without an xfb_buffer qualifier, it inherits the global default buffer. When a variable or output block is
       declared with an xfb_buffer qualifier, it has that declared buffer. All members of a block inherit the
       block's buffer. A member is allowed to declare an xfb_buffer, but it must match the buffer inherited from
       its block, or a compile-time error results.

                                                                               4 Variables and Types




   layout(xfb_buffer=2, xfb_offset=0)                out block { // block's buffer is 2
       layout(xfb_buffer = 2) vec4 v;                // okay, matches the inherited 2
       layout(xfb_buffer = 3) vec4 u;                // ERROR, mismatched buffer
       vec4 w;                                       // inherited
   };
   layout (xfb_offset=16) out vec4 t;                //   initial default is buffer 0
   layout (xfb_buffer=1) out;                        //   new global default of 1
   out block {                                       //   block has buffer 1
       vec4 x;                                       //   x has buffer 1 (not captured)
       layout(xfb_buffer = 1) vec4 y;                //   okay (not captured)
       layout(xfb_buffer = 0) vec4 z;                //   ERROR, mismatched buffer
   };
   layout(xfb_offset=0) out vec4 g;                  // g has buffer 1
   layout(xfb_buffer=2) out vec4 h;                  // does not change global default
   layout(xfb_offset=16) out vec4 j;                 // j has buffer 1

Note this means all members of a block that go to a transform feedback buffer will go to the same buffer.
It is a compile-time error to specify an xfb_buffer that is greater than the implementation-dependent
constant gl_MaxTransformFeedbackBuffers.
The xfb_offset qualifier assigns a byte offset within a transform feedback buffer. Only variables, block
members, or blocks can be qualified with xfb_offset. If a block is qualified with xfb_offset, all its
members are assigned transform feedback buffer offsets. If a block is not qualified with xfb_offset, any
members of that block not qualified with an xfb_offset will not be assigned transform feedback buffer
offsets. Only variables and block members that are assigned offsets will be captured (thus, a proper
subset of a block can be captured). Each time such a variable or block member is written in a shader, the
written value is captured at the assigned offset. If such a block member or variable is not written during a
shader invocation, the buffer contents at the assigned offset will be undefined. Even if there are no static
writes to a variable or member that is assigned a transform feedback offset, the space is still allocated in
the buffer and still affects the stride.
Variables and block members qualified with xfb_offset can be scalars, vectors, matrices, structures, and
(sized) arrays of these. The offset must be a multiple of the size of the first component of the first
qualified variable or block member, or a compile-time error results. Further, if applied to an aggregate
containing a double, the offset must also be a multiple of 8, and the space taken in the buffer will be a
multiple of 8. The given offset applies to the first component of the first member of the qualified entity.
Then, within the qualified entity, subsequent components are each assigned, in order, to the next available
offset aligned to a multiple of that component's size. Aggregate types are flattened down to the
component level to get this sequence of components. It is a compile-time error to apply xfb_offset to the
declaration of an unsized array.
No aliasing in output buffers is allowed: It is a compile-time or link-time error to specify variables with
overlapping transform feedback offsets.
The xfb_stride qualifier specifies how many bytes are consumed by each captured vertex. It applies to
the transform feedback buffer for that declaration, whether it is inherited or explicitly declared. It can be
applied to variables, blocks, block members, or just the qualifier out. If the buffer is capturing any
outputs with double-precision components, the stride must be a multiple of 8, otherwise it must be a

                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



       multiple of 4, or a compile-time or link-time error results. It is a compile-time or link-time error to have
       any xfb_offset that overflows xfb_stride, whether stated on declarations before or after the xfb_stride, or
       in different compilation units. While xfb_stride can be declared multiple times for the same buffer, it is a
       compile-time or link-time error to have different values specified for the stride for the same buffer.
       For example:

          // buffer 1 has 32-byte stride
          layout (xfb_buffer = 1, xfb_stride = 32) out;

          // same as previous example; order within layout does not matter
          layout (xfb_stride = 32, xfb_buffer = 1) out;

          // everything in this block goes to buffer 0
          layout (xfb_buffer = 0, xfb_stride = 32) out block1 {
              layout (xfb_offset = 0) vec4 a; // a goes to byte offset 0 of buffer 0
              layout (xfb_offset = 16) vec4 b; // b goes to offset 16 of buffer 0
          };

          layout (xfb_buffer = 3, xfb_offset =                12) out block2 {
              vec4 v; // v will be written to                 byte offsets 12 through 27 of buffer
              float u; // u will be written to                offset 28
              layout(xfb_offset = 40) vec4 w;
              vec4 x; // x will be written to                 offset 56, the next available offset
          };

          layout (xfb_buffer = 2, xfb_stride = 32) out block3 {
              layout (xfb_offset = 12) vec3 c;
              layout (xfb_offset = 24) vec3 d; // ERROR, requires stride of 36
              layout (xfb_offset = 0) vec3 g; // okay, increasing order not required
          };

       When no xfb_stride is specified for a buffer, the stride of the buffer will be the smallest needed to hold
       the variable placed at the highest offset, including any required padding. For example:
          // if there no other declarations for buffer 3, it has stride 32
          layout (xfb_buffer = 3) out block4 {
              layout (xfb_offset = 0) vec4 e;
              layout (xfb_offset = 16) vec4 f;
          };


       The resulting stride (implicit or explicit), when divided by 4, must be less than or equal to the
       implementation-dependent constant gl_MaxTransformFeedbackInterleavedComponents.

4.4.2.2 Tessellation Control Outputs
       Other than for the transform feedback layout qualifiers, tessellation control shaders allow output layout
       qualifiers only on the interface qualifier out, not on an output block, block member, or variable




                                                       71
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



       declaration. The output layout qualifier identifiers allowed for tessellation control shaders include the
       vertex-count layout qualifier:
            layout-qualifier-id
                 vertices = integer-constant-expression
       The identifier vertices specifies the number of vertices in the output patch produced by the tessellation
       control shader, which also specifies the number of times the tessellation control shader is invoked. It is a
       compile- or link-time error for the output vertex count to be less than or equal to zero, or greater than the
       implementation-dependent maximum patch size.
       The intrinsically declared tessellation control output array gl_out[] will also be sized by any output layout
       declaration. Hence, the expression
          gl_out.length()

      will return the output patch vertex count specified in a previous output layout qualifier. For outputs
      declared without an array size, including intrinsically declared outputs (i.e., gl_out), a layout must be must
      be declared before any use of the method length() or other array use requires its size be known.
       It is a compile-time error if the output patch vertex count specified in an output layout qualifier does not
       match the array size specified in any output variable declaration in the same shader.
       All tessellation control shader layout declarations in a program must specify the same output patch vertex
       count. There must be at least one layout qualifier specifying an output patch vertex count in any program
       containing tessellation control shaders; however, such a declaration is not required in all tessellation
       control shaders.

4.4.2.3 Geometry Outputs
       Geometry shaders can have three additional types of output layout identifiers: an output primitive type, a
       maximum output vertex count, and per-output stream numbers. The primitive type and vertex count
       identifiers are allowed only on the interface qualifier out, not on an output block, block member, or
       variable declaration. The stream identifier is allowed on the interface qualifier out, on output blocks, and
       on variable declarations.
       The layout qualifier identifiers for geometry shader outputs are
            layout-qualifier-id
                 points
                 line_strip
                 triangle_strip
                 max_vertices = integer-constant-expression
                 stream = integer-constant-expression
       The primitive type identifiers points, line_strip, and triangle_strip are used to specify the type of output
       primitive produced by the geometry shader, and only one of these is accepted. At least one geometry
       shader (compilation unit) in a program must declare an output primitive type, and all geometry shader
       output primitive type declarations in a program must declare the same primitive type. It is not required
       that all geometry shaders in a program declare an output primitive type.




                                                       72
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



The vertex count identifier max_vertices is used to specify the maximum number of vertices the shader
will ever emit in a single invocation. At least one geometry shader (compilation unit) in a program must
declare a maximum output vertex count, and all geometry shader output vertex count declarations in a
program must declare the same count. It is not required that all geometry shaders in a program declare a
count.
In this example,
   layout(triangle_strip, max_vertices                 = 60) out; // order does not matter
   layout(max_vertices = 60) out;                      // redeclaration okay
   layout(triangle_strip) out;                         // redeclaration okay
   layout(points) out;                                 // error, contradicts triangle_strip
   layout(max_vertices = 30) out;                      // error, contradicts 60

all outputs from the geometry shader are triangles and at most 60 vertices will be emitted by the shader. It
is an error for the maximum number of vertices to be greater than gl_MaxGeometryOutputVertices.
The identifier stream is used to specify that a geometry shader output variable or block is associated with
a particular vertex stream (numbered beginning with zero). A default stream number may be declared at
global scope by qualifying interface qualifier out as in this example:
   layout(stream = 1) out;

The stream number specified in such a declaration replaces any previous default and applies to all
subsequent block and variable declarations until a new default is established. The initial default stream
number is zero.
Each output block or non-block output variable is associated with a vertex stream. If the block or variable
is declared with the stream identifier, it is associated with the specified stream; otherwise, it is associated
with the current default stream. A block member may be declared with a stream identifier, but the
specified stream must match the stream associated with the containing block. One example:
   layout(stream=1) out;                             //   default is now stream 1
   out vec4 var1;                                    //   var1 gets default stream (1)
   layout(stream=2) out Block1 {                     //   "Block1" belongs to stream 2
       layout(stream=2) vec4 var2;                   //   redundant block member stream decl
       layout(stream=3) vec2 var3;                   //   ILLEGAL (must match block stream)
       vec3 var4;                                    //   belongs to stream 2
   };
   layout(stream=0) out;                             // default is now stream 0
   out vec4 var5;                                    // var5 gets default stream (0)
   out Block2 {                                      // "Block2" gets default stream (0)
       vec4 var6;
   };
   layout(stream=3) out vec4 var7;                   // var7 belongs to stream 3

Each vertex emitted by the geometry shader is assigned to a specific stream, and the attributes of the
emitted vertex are taken from the set of output blocks and variables assigned to the targeted stream. After
each vertex is emitted, the values of all output variables become undefined. Additionally, the output
variables associated with each vertex stream may share storage. Writing to an output variable associated
with one stream may overwrite output variables associated with any other stream. When emitting each




                                                73
                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



       vertex, a geometry shader should write to all outputs associated with the stream to which the vertex will
       be emitted and to no outputs associated with any other stream.
       If a geometry shader output block or variable is declared more than once, all such declarations must
       associate the variable with the same vertex stream. If any stream declaration specifies a non-existent
       stream number, the shader will fail to compile.
       Built-in geometry shader outputs are always associated with vertex stream zero.
       All geometry shader output layout declarations in a program must declare the same layout and same value
       for max_vertices. If geometry shaders are in a program, there must be at least one geometry output
       layout declaration somewhere in that program, but not all geometry shaders (compilation units) are
       required to declare it.

4.4.2.4 Fragment Outputs
       The built-in fragment shader variable gl_FragDepth may be redeclared using one of the following layout
       qualifiers.
            layout-qualifier-id
                 depth_any
                 depth_greater
                 depth_less
                 depth_unchanged
       For example:
          layout (depth_greater) out float gl_FragDepth;


       The layout qualifier for gl_FragDepth constrains intentions of the final value of gl_FragDepth written
       by any shader invocation. GL implementations are allowed to perform optimizations assuming that the
       depth test fails (or passes) for a given fragment if all values of gl_FragDepth consistent with the layout
       qualifier would fail (or pass). This potentially includes skipping shader execution if the fragment is
       discarded because it is occluded and the shader has no side effects. If the final value of gl_FragDepth is
       inconsistent with its layout qualifier, the result of the depth test for the corresponding fragment is
       undefined. However, no error will be generated in this case. If the depth test passes and depth writes are
       enabled, the value written to the depth buffer is always the value of gl_FragDepth, whether or not it is
       consistent with the layout qualifier.
       By default, gl_FragDepth is qualified as depth_any. When the layout qualifier for gl_FragDepth is
       depth_any, the shader compiler will note any assignment to gl_FragDepth modifying it in an unknown
       way, and depth testing will always be performed after the shader has executed. When the layout qualifier
       is depth_greater, the GL can assume that the final value of gl_FragDepth is greater than or equal to the
       fragment's interpolated depth value, as given by the z component of gl_FragCoord. When the layout
       qualifier is depth_less, the GL can assume that any modification of gl_FragDepth will only decrease its
       value. When the layout qualifier is depth_unchanged, the shader compiler will honor any modification to
       gl_FragDepth, but the rest of the GL can assume that gl_FragDepth is not assigned a new value.




                                                      74
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Redeclarations of gl_FragDepth are performed as follows:
           // redeclaration that changes nothing is allowed
           out float gl_FragDepth;

           // assume it may be modified in any way
           layout (depth_any) out float gl_FragDepth;

           // assume it may be modified such that its value will only increase
           layout (depth_greater) out float gl_FragDepth;

           // assume it may be modified such that its value will only decrease
           layout (depth_less) out float gl_FragDepth;

           // assume it will not be modified
           layout (depth_unchanged) out float gl_FragDepth;


        If gl_FragDepth is redeclared in any fragment shader in a program, it must be redeclared in all fragment
        shaders in that program that have static assignments to gl_FragDepth. All redeclarations of
        gl_FragDepth in all fragment shaders in a single program must have the same set of qualifiers. Within
        any shader, the first redeclarations of gl_FragDepth must appear before any use of gl_FragDepth. The
        built-in gl_FragDepth is only predeclared in fragment shaders, so redeclaring it in any other shader
        language results in a compile-time error.

4.4.3   Uniform Variable Layout Qualifiers
        Layout qualifiers can be used for uniform variables and subroutine uniforms. The layout qualifier
        identifiers for uniform variables and subroutine uniforms are:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  location = integer-constant-expression
        The location identifier can be used with default-block uniform variables and subroutine uniforms. The
        location specifies the location by which the OpenGL API can reference the uniform and update its value.
        Individual elements of a uniform array are assigned consecutive locations with the first element taking
        location location. No two default-block uniform variables in the program can have the same location,
        even if they are unused, otherwise a compile-time or link-time error will be generated. No two subroutine
        uniform variables can have the same location in the same shader stage, otherwise a compile-time or link-
        time error will be generated. Valid locations for default-block uniform variable locations are in the range
        of 0 to the implementation-defined maximum number of uniform locations minus one. Valid locations for
        subroutine uniforms are in the range of 0 to the implementation-defined per-stage maximum number of
        subroutine uniform locations minus one.
        Locations can be assigned to default-block uniform arrays and structures. The first inner-most scalar,
        vector or matrix member or element takes the specified location and the compiler assigns the next inner-
        most member or element the next incremental location value. Each subsequent inner-most member or
        element gets incremental locations for the entire structure or array. This rule applies to nested structures
        and arrays and gives each inner-most scalar, vector, or matrix type a unique location. For arrays without
        an explicit size, the size is calculated based on its static usage. When the linker generates locations for




                                                        75
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        uniforms without an explicit location, it assumes for all uniforms with an explicit location all their array
        elements and structure members are used and the linker will not generate a conflicting location, even if
        that element of member is deemed unused.

4.4.4   Subroutine Function Layout Qualifiers
        Layout qualifiers can be used for subroutine functions. The layout qualifier identifiers for subroutine
        functions are:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  index = integer-constant-expression
        Each subroutine with an index qualifier in the shader must be given a unique index, otherwise a compile-
        or link-time error will be generated. The indices must be in the range of 0 to the implementation defined
        maximum number of subroutines minus one. It is recommended, but not required, that the shader assigns
        a range of tightly packed index values starting from zero so that the OpenGL subroutine function
        enumeration API returns a non-empty name for all active indices.

4.4.5   Uniform and Shader Storage Block Layout Qualifiers
        Layout qualifiers can be used for uniform and shader storage blocks, but not for non-block uniform
        declarations. The layout qualifier identifiers (and shared keyword) for uniform and shader storage blocks
        are
             layout-qualifier-id
                  shared
                  packed
                  std140
                  std430
                  row_major
                  column_major
                  binding = integer-constant-expression
                  offset = integer-constant-expression
                  align = integer-constant-expression

        None of these have any semantic affect at all on the usage of the variables being declared; they only
        describe how data is laid out in memory. For example, matrix semantics are always column-based, as
        described in the rest of this specification, no matter what layout qualifiers are being used.
        Uniform and shader storage block layout qualifiers can be declared for global scope, on a single uniform
        or shader storage block, or on a single block member declaration.
        Default layouts for shared, packed, std140, std430, row_major, and column_major are established at
        global scope for uniform blocks as
           layout(layout-qualifier-id-list) uniform;

        and for shader storage blocks as




                                                        76
                                                                                  4 Variables and Types



   layout(layout-qualifier-id-list) buffer;

When this is done, the previous default qualification is first inherited and then overridden as per the
override rules listed below for each qualifier listed in the declaration. The result becomes the new default
qualification scoped to subsequent uniform or shader storage block definitions.
The initial state of compilation is as if the following were declared:
   layout(shared, column_major) uniform;
   layout(shared, column_major) buffer;

Explicitly declaring this in a shader will return defaults back to their initial state.
Uniform and shader storage blocks can be declared with optional layout qualifiers, and so can their
individual member declarations. Such block layout qualification is scoped only to the content of the
block. As with global layout declarations, block layout qualification first inherits from the current default
qualification and then overrides it. Similarly, individual member layout qualification is scoped just to the
member declaration, and inherits from and overrides the block's qualification.
The shared qualifier overrides only the std140, std430, and packed qualifiers; other qualifiers are
inherited. The compiler/linker will ensure that multiple programs and programmable stages containing
this definition will share the same memory layout for this block, as long as all arrays are declared with
explicit sizes and all matrices have matching row_major and/or column_major qualifications (which may
come from a declaration outside the block definition). This allows use of the same buffer to back the same
block definition across different programs.
The packed qualifier overrides only std140, std430, and shared; other qualifiers are inherited. When
packed is used, no shareable layout is guaranteed. The compiler and linker can optimize memory use
based on what variables actively get used and on other criteria. Offsets must be queried, as there is no
other way of guaranteeing where (and which) variables reside within the block. Accessing the same
packed uniform or shader storage block in multiple stages within a program may result in a link-time
error. If no link-time error is given, then members will have the same offsets across stages and reads will
be well defined. Accessing the same packed uniform or shader storage block across programs can result
in conflicting member offsets and in undefined values being read. However, implementations may aid
application management of packed blocks by using canonical layouts for packed blocks.
The std140 and std430 qualifiers override only the packed, shared, std140, and std430 qualifiers; other
qualifiers are inherited. The std430 qualifier is supported only for shader storage blocks; using std430 on
a uniform block will result in a compile-time error. The layout is explicitly determined by this, as
described in section 7.6.2 âUniform Blocks" under Standard Uniform Block Layout of the OpenGL
Graphics System Specification. Hence, as in shared above, the resulting layout is shareable across
programs.
Layout qualifiers on member declarations cannot use the shared, packed, std140, or std430 qualifiers.
These can only be used at global scope or on a block declaration, or a compile-time error results.
The row_major and column_major qualifiers affect the layout of matrices, including all matrices
contained in structures and arrays they are applied to, to all depths of nesting. These qualifiers can be
applied to other types, but will have no effect.




                                                  77
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



The row_major qualifier overrides only the column_major qualifier; other qualifiers are inherited.
Elements within a matrix row will be contiguous in memory.
The column_major qualifier overrides only the row_major qualifier; other qualifiers are inherited.
Elements within a matrix column will be contiguous in memory.
The binding identifier specifies the uniform buffer binding point corresponding to the uniform or shader
storage block, which will be used to obtain the values of the member variables of the block. It is a
compile-time error to specify the binding identifier for the global scope or for block member declarations.
Any uniform or shader storage block declared without a binding identifier is initially assigned to block
binding point zero. After a program is linked, the binding points used for uniform and shader storage
blocks declared with or without a binding identifier can be updated by the OpenGL API.
If the binding identifier is used with a uniform or shader storage block instanced as an array, the first
element of the array takes the specified block binding and each subsequent element takes the next
consecutive uniform block binding point.
If the binding point for any uniform or shader storage block instance is less than zero, or greater than or
equal to the implementation-dependent maximum number of uniform buffer bindings, a compile-time
error will occur. When the binding identifier is used with a uniform or shader storage block instanced as
an array of size N, all elements of the array from binding through binding + N â 1 must be within this
range.
When multiple arguments are listed in a layout declaration, the effect will be the same as if they were
declared one at a time, in order from left to right, each in turn inheriting from and overriding the result
from the previous qualification.
For example
   layout(row_major, column_major)

results in the qualification being column_major. Other examples:
   layout(shared, row_major) uniform; // default is now shared and row_major

   layout(std140) uniform Transform {                //   layout of this block is std140
       mat4 M1;                                      //   row_major
       layout(column_major) mat4 M2;                 //   column major
       mat3 N1;                                      //   row_major
   };

   uniform T2 {        // layout of this block is shared
       ...
   };

   layout(column_major) uniform T3 {                 //   shared and column_major
       mat4 M3;                                      //   column_major
       layout(row_major) mat4 m4;                    //   row major
       mat3 N2;                                      //   column_major
   };




                                                78
                                                                                          4 Variables and Types



        The offset qualifier can only be used on block members of blocks declared with std140 or std430 layouts.
        The offset qualifier forces the qualified member to start at or after the specified integral-constant-
        expression, which will be its byte offset from the beginning of the buffer. It is a compile-time error to
        specify an offset that is smaller than the offset of the previous member in the block or that lies within the
        previous member of the block. Two blocks linked together in the same program with the same block
        name must have the exact same set of members qualified with offset and their integral-constant-
        expression values must be the same, or a link-time error results. The specified offset must be a multiple
        of the base alignment of the type of the block member it qualifies, or a compile-time error results.
        The align qualifier can only be used on blocks or block members, and only for blocks declared with
        std140 or std430 layouts. The align qualifier makes the start of each block member have a minimum
        byte alignment. It does not affect the internal layout within each member, which will still follow the
        std140 or std430 rules. The specified alignment must be a power of 2, or a compile-time error results.
        The actual alignment of a member will be the greater of the specified align alignment and the standard
        (e.g., std140) base alignment for the member's type. The actual offset of a member is computed as
        follows: If offset was declared, start with that offset, otherwise start with the next available offset. If the
        resulting offset is not a multiple of the actual alignment, increase it to the first offset that is a multiple of
        the actual alignment. This results in the actual offset the member will have.
        When align is applied to an array, it effects only the start of the array, not the array's internal stride. Both
        an offset and an align qualifier can be specified on a declaration.
        The align qualifier, when used on a block, has the same effect as qualifying each member with the same
        align value as declared on the block, and gets the same compile-time results and errors as if this had been
        done. As described in general earlier, an individual member can specify its own align, which overrides
        the block-level align, but just for that member.
        Examples:
           layout(std140) uniform block {
                                   vec4                  a;        //   a takes offsets 0-15
               layout(offset = 20) vec3                  b;        //   b takes offsets 32-43
               layout(offset = 40) vec2                  c;        //   ERROR, lies within previous member
               layout(offset = 48) vec2                  d;        //   d takes offsets 48-55
               layout(align = 16) float                  e;        //   e takes offsets 64-67
               layout(align = 2)   double                f;        //   f takes offsets 72-79
               layout(align = 6)   double                g;        //   ERROR, 6 is not a power of 2
               layout(offset = 80) float                 h;        //   h takes offsets 80-83
               layout(align = 64) dvec3                  i;        //   i takes offsets 128-151
               layout(offset = 153, align                = 8)
                                   float                 j;        // j takes offsets 160-163
           };

4.4.6   Opaque-Uniform Layout Qualifiers
        Uniform layout qualifiers can be used to bind opaque uniform variables to specific buffers or units.
        Texture image units can be bound to samplers, image units can be bound to images, and atomic counters
        can be bound to buffers.
        Details for specific to image formats and atomic counter bindings are given in the subsections below.




                                                          79
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



       Image and sampler types both take the uniform layout qualifier identifier for binding:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  binding = integer-constant-expression
       The identifier binding specifies which unit will be bound. Any uniform sampler or image variable
       declared without a binding qualifier is initially bound to unit zero. After a program is linked, the unit
       referenced by a sampler or image uniform variable declared with or without a binding identifier can be
       updated by the OpenGL API.
       If the binding identifier is used with an array, the first element of the array takes the specified unit and
       each subsequent element takes the next consecutive unit.
       If the binding is less than zero, or greater than or equal to the implementation-dependent maximum
       supported number of units, a compile-time error will occur. When the binding identifier is used with an
       array of size N, all elements of the array from binding through binding + N - 1 must be within this range.
       A link-time error will result if two compilation units in a program specify different integer-constant-
       expression bindings for the same opaque-uniform name. However, it is not an error to specify a binding
       on some but not all declarations for the same name, as shown in the examples below.
          // in one compilation unit...
          layout(binding=3) uniform sampler2D s; // s bound to unit 3

          // in another compilation unit...
          uniform sampler2D s;                                    // okay, s still bound at 3

          // in another compilation unit...
          layout(binding=4) uniform sampler2D s; // ERROR: contradictory bindings

4.4.6.1 Atomic Counter Layout Qualifiers
       The atomic counter qualifiers are
            layout-qualifier-id
                 binding = integer-constant-expression
                 offset = integer-constant-expression
       For example,
          layout (binding = 2, offset = 4) uniform atomic_uint a;

       will establish that the opaque handle to the atomic counter a will be bound to atomic counter buffer
       binding point 2 at an offset of 4 basic machine units into that buffer. The default offset for binding point 2
       will be post incremented by 4 (the size of an atomic counter).
       A subsequent atomic counter declaration will inherit the previous (post incremented) offset. For example,
       a subsequent declaration of




                                                        80
                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



          layout (binding = 2) uniform atomic_uint bar;

       will establish that the atomic counter bar has a binding to buffer binding point 2 at an offset of 8 basic
       machine units into that buffer. The offset for binding point 2 will again be post-incremented by 4 (the size
       of an atomic counter).
       When multiple variables are listed in a layout declaration, the effect will be the same as if they were
       declared one at a time, in order from left to right.
       Binding points are not inherited, only offsets. Each binding point tracks its own current default offset for
       inheritance of subsequent variables using the same binding. The initial state of compilation is that all
       binding points have an offset of 0. The offset can be set per binding point at global scope (without
       declaring a variable). For example,
          layout (binding = 2, offset = 4) uniform atomic_uint;

       Establishes that the next atomic_uint declaration for binding point 2 will inherit offset 4 (but does not
       establish a default binding):
          layout (binding = 2) uniform atomic_uint bar; // offset is 4
          layout (offset = 8) uniform atomic_uint bar; // error, no default binding

       Atomic counters may share the same binding point, but if a binding is shared, their offsets must be either
       explicitly or implicitly (from inheritance) unique and non overlapping.
       Example valid uniform declarations, assuming top of shader:
          layout    (binding=3,      offset=4) uniform atomic_uint a; // offset =                   4
          layout    (binding=2)      uniform atomic_uint b;           // offset =                   0
          layout    (binding=3)      uniform atomic_uint c;           // offset =                   8
          layout    (binding=2)      uniform atomic_uint d;           // offset =                   4

       Example of an invalid uniform declaration:
          layout (offset=4) â¦               //                error, must include binding
          layout (binding=1, offset=0) â¦ a; //                okay
          layout (binding=2, offset=0) â¦ b; //                okay
          layout (binding=1, offset=0) â¦ c; //                error, offsets must not be shared
                                            //                       between a and c
          layout (binding=1, offset=2) â¦ d; //                error, overlaps offset 0 of a

       It is a compile-time error to bind an atomic counter with a binding value greater than or equal to
       gl_MaxAtomicCounterBindings.

4.4.6.2 Format Layout Qualifiers
       Format layout qualifiers can be used on image variable declarations (those declared with a basic type
       having âimageâ in its keyword). The format layout qualifier identifiers for image variable declarations
       are
            layout-qualifier-id
                 float-image-format-qualifier

      A format layout qualifier specifies the image format associated with a declared image variable. Only one
      format qualifier may be specified for any image variable declaration. For image variables with floating-
      point component types (keywords starting with âimageâ), signed integer component types (keywords
      starting with âiimageâ), or unsigned integer component types (keywords starting with âuimageâ), the
      format qualifier used must match the float-image-format-qualifier, int-image-format-qualifier, or uint-
      image-format-qualifier grammar rules, respectively. It is a compile-time error to declare an image
      variable where the format qualifier does not match the image variable type.
      Any image variable used for image loads or atomic operations must specify a format layout qualifier; it is
      a compile-time error to pass an image uniform variable or function parameter declared without a format
      layout qualifier to an image load or atomic function.
      The binding identifier was described in section 4.4.5 âUniform and Shader Storage Block Layout
      Qualifiersâ.
      Uniforms not qualified with writeonly must have a format layout qualifier. Note that an image variable
      passed to a function for read access cannot be declared as writeonly and hence must have been declared
      with a format layout qualifier.

4.5   Interpolation Qualifiers
      Inputs and outputs that could be interpolated can be further qualified by at most one of the following
      interpolation qualifiers:

             Qualifier                    Meaning
             smooth                       perspective correct interpolation
             flat                         no interpolation
             noperspective                linear interpolation


      The presence of and type of interpolation is controlled by the above interpolation qualifiers as well as the
      auxiliary storage qualifiers centroid and sample. The auxiliary storage qualifier patch is not used for
      interpolation; it is a compile-time error to use interpolation qualifiers with patch.
      A variable qualified as flat will not be interpolated. Instead, it will have the same value for every
      fragment within a triangle. This value will come from a single provoking vertex, as described by the
      OpenGL Graphics System Specification. A variable may be qualified as flat can also be qualified as
      centroid or sample, which will mean the same thing as qualifying it only as flat.
      A variable qualified as smooth will be interpolated in a perspective-correct manner over the primitive
      being rendered. Interpolation in a perspective correct manner is specified in equation 14.7 in the OpenGL
      Graphics System Specification, section 14.5 âLine Segmentsâ.
      A variable qualified as noperspective must be interpolated linearly in screen space, as described in
      equation 3.7 in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, section 3.5 âLine Segmentsâ.
      When multi-sample rasterization is disabled, or for fragment shader input variables qualified with neither
      centroid nor sample, the value of the assigned variable may be interpolated anywhere within the pixel
      and a single value may be assigned to each sample within the pixel, to the extent permitted by the
      OpenGL Graphics System Specification.




                                                     83
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        When multisample rasterization is enabled, centroid and sample may be used to control the location and
        frequency of the sampling of the qualified fragment shader input. If a fragment shader input is qualified
        with centroid, a single value may be assigned to that variable for all samples in the pixel, but that value
        must be interpolated to a location that lies in both the pixel and in the primitive being rendered, including
        any of the pixel's samples covered by the primitive. Because the location at which the variable is
        interpolated may be different in neighboring pixels, and derivatives may be computed by computing
        differences between neighboring pixels, derivatives of centroid-sampled inputs may be less accurate than
        those for non-centroid interpolated variables. If a fragment shader input is qualified with sample, a
        separate value must be assigned to that variable for each covered sample in the pixel, and that value must
        be sampled at the location of the individual sample.
        It is a link-time error if, within the same stage, the interpolation qualifiers of variables of the same name
        do not match.

4.5.1   Redeclaring Built-in Interpolation Variables in the Compatibility Profile
        The following predeclared variables can be redeclared with an interpolation qualifier when using the
        compatibility profile:
        Vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, and geometry languages:
           gl_FrontColor
           gl_BackColor
           gl_FrontSecondaryColor
           gl_BackSecondaryColor

        Fragment language:
           gl_Color
           gl_SecondaryColor

        For example,
           in vec4 gl_Color;                          //   predeclared by the fragment language
           flat in vec4 gl_Color;                     //   redeclared by user to be flat
           flat in vec4 gl_FrontColor;                //   input to geometry shader, no âgl_in[]â
           flat out vec4 gl_FrontColor;               //   output from geometry shader

        Ideally, these are redeclared as part of the redeclaration of an interface block, as described in section 7.1.1
        âCompatibility Profile Built-In Language Variablesâ. However, for the above purpose, they can be
        redeclared as individual variables at global scope, outside an interface block. Such redeclarations also
        allow adding the transform-feedback qualifiers xfb_buffer, xfb_stride, and xfb_offset to output
        variables. (Using xfb_buffer on a variable does not change the global default buffer.) A compile-time
        error will result if a shader has both an interface block redeclaration and a separate redeclaration of a
        member of that interface block outside the interface block redeclaration.
        If gl_Color is redeclared with an interpolation qualifier, then gl_FrontColor and gl_BackColor (if they
        are written to) must also be redeclared with the same interpolation qualifier, and vice versa. If
        gl_SecondaryColor is redeclared with an interpolation qualifier, then gl_FrontSecondaryColor and
        gl_BackSecondaryColor (if they are written to) must also be redeclared with the same interpolation

        qualifier, and vice versa. This qualifier matching on predeclared variables is only required for variables
        that are statically used within the shaders in a program.

4.6     Parameter Qualifiers
        In addition to precision qualifiers and memory qualifiers, parameters can have these parameter qualifiers.


                 Qualifier             Meaning
                 < none: default >     same is in
                 const                 for function parameters that cannot be written to
                 in                    for function parameters passed into a function
                 out                   for function parameters passed back out of a function, but not initialized
                                       for use when passed in
                 inout                 for function parameters passed both into and out of a function


        Parameter qualifiers are discussed in more detail in section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.

4.7     Precision and Precision Qualifiers
        Precision qualifiers are added for code portability with OpenGL ES, not for functionality. They have the
        same syntax as in OpenGL ES, as described below, but they have no semantic meaning, which includes no
        effect on the precision used to store or operate on variables.
        If an extension adds in the same semantics and functionality in the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification for
        precision qualifiers, then the extension is allowed to reuse the keywords below for that purpose.
        For the purposes of determining if an output from one shader stage matches an input of the next stage, the
        precision qualifier need not match.

4.7.1   Range and Precision
        The precision of stored single- and double-precision floating-point variables is defined by the IEEE 754
        standard for 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers. This includes support for NaNs (Not a Number)
        and Infs (positive or negative infinities).
        The following rules apply to both single and double-precision operations: Infinities and zeros are
        generated as dictated by IEEE, but subject to the precisions allowed in the following table and subject to
        allowing positive and negative zeros to be interchanged. However, dividing a non-zero by 0 results in the
        appropriately signed IEEE Inf: If both positive and negative zeros are implemented, the correctly signed
        Inf will be generated, otherwise positive Inf is generated. Any denormalized value input into a shader or
        potentially generated by any operation in a shader can be flushed to 0. The rounding mode cannot be set
        and is undefined. NaNs are not required to be generated. Support for signaling NaNs is not required and
        exceptions are never raised. Operations and built-in functions that operate on a NaN are not required to
        return a NaN as the result.




                                                       85
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        Precisions are expressed in terms of maximum relative error in units of ULP (units in the last place),
        unless otherwise noted.
        For single precision operations, precisions are required as follows:

              Operation                          Precision
              a + b, a â b, a * b                Correctly rounded.
              <, <=, ==, >, >=                   Correct result.
              a / b,    1.0 / b                  2.5 ULP for b in the range [2-126, 2126].
              a*b+c                              Correctly rounded single operation or sequence of
                                                 two correctly rounded operations.
              fma()                              Inherited from a * b + c.
              pow(x, y)                          Inherited from exp2 (x * log2 (y)).
              exp (x), exp2 (x)                  (3 + 2 * |x|) ULP.
              log (), log2 ()                    3 ULP outside the range [0.5, 2.0].
                                                 Absolute error < 2-21 inside the range [0.5, 2.0].
              sqrt ()                            Inherited from 1.0 / inversesqrt().
              inversesqrt ()                     2 ULP.
              implicit and explicit              Correctly rounded.
              conversions between types


        Built-in functions defined in the specification with an equation built from the above operations inherit the
        above errors. These include, for example, the geometric functions, the common functions, and many of
        the matrix functions. Built-in functions not listed above and not defined as equations of the above have
        undefined precision. These include, for example, the trigonometric functions and determinant.
        The precision of double-precision operations is at least that of single precision.

4.7.2   Precision Qualifiers
        Any single-precision floating-point declaration, integer declaration, or sampler declaration can have the
        type preceded by one of these precision qualifiers:

                 Qualifier              Meaning
                 highp                  None.
                 mediump                None.
                 lowp                   None.




                                                        86
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        For example:
           lowp float color;
           out mediump vec2 P;
           lowp ivec2 foo(lowp mat3);
           highp mat4 m;

        Literal constants do not have precision qualifiers. Neither do Boolean variables. Neither do floating-point
        constructors nor integer constructors when none of the constructor arguments have precision qualifiers.
        Precision qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not effect the basic type of the variable. In particular,
        there are no constructors for precision conversions; constructors only convert types. Similarly, precision
        qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not contribute to function overloading based on parameter types. As
        discussed in the next chapter, function input and output is done through copies, and therefore qualifiers do
        not have to match.

4.7.3   Default Precision Qualifiers
        The precision statement
           precision precision-qualifier type;

        can be used to establish a default precision qualifier. The type field can be either int, or float, or any of
        the sampler types, and the precision-qualifier can be lowp, mediump, or highp. Any other types or
        qualifiers will result in a compile-time error. If type is float, the directive applies to non-precision-
        qualified single-precision floating-point type (scalar, vector, and matrix) declarations. If type is int, the
        directive applies to all non-precision-qualified integer type (scalar, vector, signed, and unsigned)
        declarations. This includes global variable declarations, function return declarations, function parameter
        declarations, and local variable declarations.
        Non-precision qualified declarations will use the precision qualifier specified in the most recent precision
        statement that is still in scope. The precision statement has the same scoping rules as variable
        declarations. If it is declared inside a compound statement, its effect stops at the end of the innermost
        statement it was declared in. Precision statements in nested scopes override precision statements in outer
        scopes. Multiple precision statements for the same basic type can appear inside the same scope, with later
        statements overriding earlier statements within that scope.
        The vertex, tessellation, and geometry languages have the following predeclared globally scoped default
        precision statements:
           precision highp float;
           precision highp int;

        The fragment language has the following predeclared globally scoped default precision statements:
           precision mediump int;
           precision highp float;

        There are no errors for omission of a precision qualifier; so the above is just for reference of what may
        happen in OpenGL ES versions of the shading languages.




                                                        87
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



4.7.4   Available Precision Qualifiers
        The built-in macro GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH is defined to 1:
            #define GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH 1

        This macro is available in the vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment languages.

4.8     Variance and the Invariant Qualifier
        In this section, variance refers to the possibility of getting different values from the same expression in
        different programs. For example, say two vertex shaders, in different programs, each set gl_Position with
        the same expression in both shaders, and the input values into that expression are the same when both
        shaders run. It is possible, due to independent compilation of the two shaders, that the values assigned to
        gl_Position are not exactly the same when the two shaders run. In this example, this can cause problems
        with alignment of geometry in a multi-pass algorithm.
        In general, such variance between shaders is allowed. When such variance does not exist for a particular
        output variable, that variable is said to be invariant.

4.8.1   The Invariant Qualifier
        To ensure that a particular output variable is invariant, it is necessary to use the invariant qualifier. It can
        either be used to qualify a previously declared variable as being invariant
            invariant gl_Position;             // make existing gl_Position be invariant

            out vec3 Color;
            invariant Color;                   // make existing Color be invariant

        or as part of a declaration when a variable is declared
            invariant centroid out vec3 Color;

        Only variables output from a shader (including those that are then input to a subsequent shader) can be
        candidates for invariance. This includes user-defined output variables and the built-in output variables.
        As only outputs need be declared with invariant, an output from one shader stage will still match an input
        of a subsequent stage without the input being declared as invariant.
        Input or output instance names on blocks are not used when redeclaring built-in variables.
        The invariant keyword can be followed by a comma separated list of previously declared identifiers. All
        uses of invariant must be at the global scope, and before any use of the variables being declared as
        invariant.
        To guarantee invariance of a particular output variable across two programs, the following must also be
        true:
        â¢   The output variable is declared as invariant in both programs.
        â¢   The same values must be input to all shader input variables consumed by expressions and flow control
            contributing to the value assigned to the output variable.




                                                        88
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        â¢   The texture formats, texel values, and texture filtering are set the same way for any texture function
            calls contributing to the value of the output variable.
        â¢   All input values are all operated on in the same way. All operations in the consuming expressions and
            any intermediate expressions must be the same, with the same order of operands and same
            associativity, to give the same order of evaluation. Intermediate variables and functions must be
            declared as the same type with the same explicit or implicit precision qualifiers. Any control flow
            affecting the output value must be the same, and any expressions consumed to determine this control
            flow must also follow these invariance rules.
        â¢   All the data flow and control flow leading to setting the invariant output variable reside in a single
            compilation unit.
        Essentially, all the data flow and control flow leading to an invariant output must match.
        Initially, by default, all output variables are allowed to be variant. To force all output variables to be
        invariant, use the pragma
            #pragma STDGL invariant(all)

        before all declarations in a shader. If this pragma is used after the declaration of any variables or
        functions, then the set of outputs that behave as invariant is undefined. It is a compile-time error to use
        this pragma in a fragment shader.
        Generally, invariance is ensured at the cost of flexibility in optimization, so performance can be degraded
        by use of invariance. Hence, use of this pragma is intended as a debug aid, to avoid individually declaring
        all output variables as invariant.

4.8.2   Invariance of Constant Expressions
        Invariance must be guaranteed for constant expressions. A particular constant expression must evaluate to
        the same result if it appears again in the same shader or a different shader. This includes the same
        expression appearing two shaders of the same language or shaders of two different languages.
        Constant expressions must evaluate to the same result when operated on as already described above for
        invariant variables, whether or not the invariant qualifier is used.

4.9     The Precise Qualifier
        Some algorithms require floating-point computations to exactly follow the order of operations specified in
        the source code and to treat all operations consistently, even if the implementation supports optimizations
        that could produce nearly equivalent results with higher performance. For example, many GL
        implementations support a "multiply-add" instruction that can compute a floating-point expression such as
            result = (a * b) + (c * d);

        in two operations instead of three operations; one multiply and one multiply-add instead of two multiplies
        and one add. The result of a floating-point multiply-add might not always be identical to first doing a
        multiply yielding a floating-point result and then doing a floating-point add. Hence, in this example, the
        two multiply operations would not be treated consistently; the two multiplies could effectively appear to
        have differing precisions.




                                                        89
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



 The key computation that needs to be made consistent appears when tessellating, where intermediate
 points for subdivision are synthesized in different directions, yet need to yield the same result, as shown in
 the diagram below.


                                                           Corner points
                                                      start with same values

                                                      Opposing directions
Subdivision points                                     of edge walking
need to land on the                                     for subdivision
 same location to
 prevent cracking




                                                        Corner points
                                                   start with same values


 Without any qualifiers, implementations are permitted to perform such optimizations that effectively
 modify the order or number of operations used to evaluate an expression, even if those optimizations may
 produce slightly different results relative to unoptimized code.
 The qualifier precise will ensure that operations contributing to a variable's value are done in their stated
 order and are done with operator consistency. Order is determined by operator precedence and
 parenthesis, as described in section 5.1 âOperatorsâ. Operator consistency means for each particular
 operator, for example the multiply operator ( * ), its operation is always computed with the same
 precision. Specifically, values computed by compiler-generated code must adhere to the following
 identities:
      1.   a+b=b+a
      2.   a*b=b*a
      3.   a * b + c * d = b * a + c* d = d * c + b * a = <any other mathematically valid combination>
 While the following are prevented:
      4.   a + (b + c) is not allowed to become (a + b) + c
      5.   a * (b * c) is not allowed to become (a * b) * c
      6.   a * b + c is not allowed to become a single operation fma(a, b, c)
 Where a, b, c, and d, are scalars or vectors, not matrices. (Matrix multiplication generally does not
 commute.) It is the shader writer's responsibility to express the computation in terms of these rules and
 the compiler's responsibility to follow these rules. See the description of gl_TessCoord for the rules the
 tessellation stages are responsible for following, which in conjunction with the above allow avoiding
 cracking when subdividing.

                                                                                4 Variables and Types



For example,
   precise out vec4 position;

declares that operations used to produce the value of position must be performed in exactly the order
specified in the source code and with all operators being treated consistently. As with the invariant
qualifier (section 4.8.1 âThe Invariant Qualifierâ), the precise qualifier may be used to qualify a built-in or
previously declared user-defined variable as being precise:
   out vec3 Color;
   precise Color;                       // make existing Color be precise

This qualifier will affect the evaluation of an r-value in a particular function if and only if the result is
eventually consumed in the same function by an l-value qualified as precise. Any other expressions
within a function are not affected, including return values and output parameters not declared as precise
but that are eventually consumed outside the function by an variable qualified as precise.

                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



       Some examples of the use of precise:
          in vec4 a, b, c, d;
          precise out vec4 v;

          float func(float e, float f, float g, float h)
          {
              return (e*f) + (g*h);            // no constraint on order or
                                               // operator consistency
          }

          float func2(float e, float f, float g, float h)
          {
              precise float result = (e*f) + (g*h); // ensures same precision for
                                                     // the two multiplies
              return result;
          }

          float func3(float i, float j, precise out float k)
          {
              k = i * i + j;                   // precise, due to <k> declaration
          }

          void main()
          {
              vec3 r = vec3(a * b);            // precise, used to compute v.xyz
              vec3 s = vec3(c * d);            // precise, used to compute v.xyz
              v.xyz = r + s;                           // precise
              v.w = (a.w * b.w) + (c.w * d.w);         // precise
              v.x = func(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x);          // values computed in func()
                                                       // are NOT precise
              v.x = func2(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x);         // precise!
              func3(a.x * b.x, c.x * d.x, v.x);        // precise!
          }

       For the purposes of determining if an output from one shader stage matches an input of the next stage, the
       precise qualifier need not match between the input and the output.
       All constant expressions are evaluated as if precise was present, whether or not it is present. However, as
       described in section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ, there is no requirement that a compile-time constant
       expression evaluates to the same value as a corresponding non-constant expression.

4.10   Memory Qualifiers
       Variables declared as image types (the basic opaque types with âimageâ in their keyword) can be further
       qualified with one or more of the following memory qualifiers:




                                                     92
                                                                             4 Variables and Types



       Qualifier                   Meaning
       coherent                    memory variable where reads and writes are coherent with reads and
                                   writes from other shader invocations
       volatile                    memory variable whose underlying value may be changed at any point
                                   during shader execution by some source other than the current shader
                                   invocation
       restrict                    memory variable where use of that variable is the only way to read
                                   and write the underlying memory in the relevant shader stage
       readonly                    memory variable that can be used to read the underlying memory, but
                                   cannot be used to write the underlying memory
       writeonly                   memory variable that can be used to write the underlying memory, but
                                   cannot be used to read the underlying memory


Memory accesses to image variables declared using the coherent qualifier are performed coherently with
similar accesses from other shader invocations. In particular, when reading a variable declared as
coherent, the values returned will reflect the results of previously completed writes performed by other
shader invocations. When writing a variable declared as coherent, the values written will be reflected in
subsequent coherent reads performed by other shader invocations. As described in section 7.11 âShader
Memory Accessâ of the OpenGL Specification, shader memory reads and writes complete in a largely
undefined order. The built-in function memoryBarrier() can be used if needed to guarantee the
completion and relative ordering of memory accesses performed by a single shader invocation.
When accessing memory using variables not declared as coherent, the memory accessed by a shader may
be cached by the implementation to service future accesses to the same address. Memory stores may be
cached in such a way that the values written might not be visible to other shader invocations accessing the
same memory. The implementation may cache the values fetched by memory reads and return the same
values to any shader invocation accessing the same memory, even if the underlying memory has been
modified since the first memory read. While variables not declared as coherent might not be useful for
communicating between shader invocations, using non-coherent accesses may result in higher
performance.
Memory accesses to image variables declared using the volatile qualifier must treat the underlying
memory as though it could be read or written at any point during shader execution by some source other
than the executing shader invocation. When a volatile variable is read, its value must be re-fetched from
the underlying memory, even if the shader invocation performing the read had previously fetched its value
from the same memory. When a volatile variable is written, its value must be written to the underlying
memory, even if the compiler can conclusively determine that its value will be overwritten by a
subsequent write. Since the external source reading or writing a volatile variable may be another shader
invocation, variables declared as volatile are automatically treated as coherent.
Memory accesses to image variables declared using the restrict qualifier may be compiled assuming that
the variable used to perform the memory access is the only way to access the underlying memory using
the shader stage in question. This allows the compiler to coalesce or reorder loads and stores using
restrict-qualified image variables in ways that wouldn't be permitted for image variables not so qualified,
because the compiler can assume that the underlying image won't be read or written by other code.
Applications are responsible for ensuring that image memory referenced by variables qualified with




                                               93
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



restrict will not be referenced using other variables in the same scope; otherwise, accesses to restrict-
qualified variables will have undefined results.
Memory accesses to image variables declared using the readonly qualifier may only read the underlying
memory, which is treated as read-only memory and cannot be written to. It is a compile-time error to pass
an image variable qualified with readonly to imageStore() or other built-in functions that modify image
memory.
Memory accesses to image variables declared using the writeonly qualifier may only write the underlying
memory; the underlying memory cannot be read. It is a compile-time error to pass an image variable
qualified with writeonly to imageLoad() or other built-in functions that read image memory. A variable
could be qualified as both readonly and writeonly, disallowing both read and write, but still be passed to
imageSize() to have the size queried.
The memory qualifiers coherent, volatile, restrict, readonly, and writeonly may be used in the
declaration of buffer variables (i.e., members of shader storage blocks). When a buffer variable is
declared with a memory qualifier, the behavior specified for memory accesses involving image variables
described above applies identically to memory accesses involving that buffer variable. It is a compile-
time error to assign to a buffer variable qualified with readonly or to read from a buffer variable qualified
with writeonly.
Additionally, memory qualifiers may also be used in the declaration of shader storage blocks. When a
block declaration is qualified with a memory qualifier, it is as if all of its members were declared with the
same memory qualifier. For example, the block declaration
   coherent buffer Block {
       readonly vec4 member1;
       vec4 member2;
   };

is equivalent to
   buffer Block {
       coherent readonly vec4 member1;
       coherent vec4 member2;
   };

Memory qualifiers are only supported in the declarations of image variables, buffer variables, and shader
storage blocks; it is an error to use such qualifiers in any other declarations.
The values of image variables qualified with coherent, volatile, restrict, readonly, or writeonly may not
be passed to functions whose formal parameters lack such qualifiers. (See section 6.1 âFunction
Definitionsâ for more detail on function calling.) It is legal to have additional qualifiers on a formal
parameter, but not to have fewer.

                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



          vec4 funcA(restrict image2D a)   { ... }
          vec4 funcB(image2D a)            { ... }
          layout(rgba32f) uniform image2D img1;
          layout(rgba32f) coherent uniform image2D img2;

          funcA(img1);                        // OK, adding "restrict" is allowed
          funcB(img2);                        // illegal, stripping "coherent" is not


       Layout qualifiers cannot be used on formal function parameters, but they are not included in parameter
       matching.
       Note that the use of const in an image variable declaration is qualifying the const-ness of variable being
       declared, not the image it refers to: The qualifier readonly qualifies the image memory (as accessed
       through that variable) while const qualifiers the variable itself.

4.11   Order and Repetition of Qualification
       When multiple qualifiers are present in a variable or parameter declaration, they may appear in any order,
       but they must all appear before the type. The layout qualifier is the only qualifier that can appear more
       than once. Further, a declaration can have at most one storage qualifier, at most one auxiliary storage
       qualifier, and at most one interpolation qualifier. If inout is used, neither in nor out may be used.
       Multiple memory qualifiers can be used. Any violation of these rules will cause a compile-time error.

                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



5.2     Array Operations
        These are now described in section 5.7 âStructure and Array Operationsâ.

5.3     Function Calls
        If a function returns a value, then a call to that function may be used as an expression, whose type will be
        the type that was used to declare or define the function.
        Function definitions and calling conventions are discussed in section 6.1 âFunction Definitionsâ .

5.4     Constructors
        Constructors use the function call syntax, where the function name is a type, and the call makes an object
        of that type. Constructors are used the same way in both initializers and expressions. (See section 9
        âShading Language Grammarâ for details.) The parameters are used to initialize the constructed value.
        Constructors can be used to request a data type conversion to change from one scalar type to another
        scalar type, or to build larger types out of smaller types, or to reduce a larger type to a smaller type.
        In general, constructors are not built-in functions with predetermined prototypes. For arrays and
        structures, there must be exactly one argument in the constructor for each element or member. For the
        other types, the arguments must provide a sufficient number of components to perform the initialization,
        and it is a compile-time error to include so many arguments that they cannot all be used. Detailed rules
        follow. The prototypes actually listed below are merely a subset of examples.

5.4.1   Conversion and Scalar Constructors
        Converting between scalar types is done as the following prototypes indicate:
           int(uint)    //        converts    an unsigned integer to a signed integer
           int(bool)    //        converts    a Boolean value to an int
           int(float)   //        converts    a float value to an int
           int(double) //         converts    a double value to a signed integer
           uint(int)    //        converts    a signed integer value to an unsigned integer
           uint(bool)   //        converts    a Boolean value to an unsigned integer
           uint(float) //         converts    a float value to an unsigned integer
           uint(double) //        converts    a double value to an unsigned integer
           bool(int)    //        converts    a signed integer value to a Boolean
           bool(uint)   //        converts    an unsigned integer value to a Boolean value
           bool(float) //         converts    a float value to a Boolean
           bool(double) //        converts    a double value to a Boolean
           float(int)   //        converts    a signed integer value to a float
           float(uint) //         converts    an unsigned integer value to a float value
           float(bool) //         converts    a Boolean value to a float
           float(double)//        converts    a double value to a float
           double(int) //         converts    a signed integer value to a double
           double(uint) //        converts    an unsigned integer value to a double
           double(bool) //        converts    a Boolean value to a double
           double(float)//        converts    a float value to a double




                                                       97
                                                                                 5 Operators and Expressions



        When constructors are used to convert any floating-point type to an integer type, the fractional part of the
        floating-point value is dropped. It is undefined to convert a negative floating-point value to an uint.
        When a constructor is used to convert any integer or floating-point type to a bool, 0 and 0.0 are converted
        to false, and non-zero values are converted to true. When a constructor is used to convert a bool to any
        integer or floating-point type, false is converted to 0 or 0.0, and true is converted to 1 or 1.0.
        The constructor int(uint) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will change the argument's
        value if its sign bit is set. The constructor uint(int) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will
        change its value if it is negative.
        Identity constructors, like float(float) are also legal, but of little use.
        Scalar constructors with non-scalar parameters can be used to take the first element from a non-scalar.
        For example, the constructor float(vec3) will select the first component of the vec3 parameter.

5.4.2   Vector and Matrix Constructors
        Constructors can be used to create vectors or matrices from a set of scalars, vectors, or matrices. This
        includes the ability to shorten vectors.
        If there is a single scalar parameter to a vector constructor, it is used to initialize all components of the
        constructed vector to that scalarâs value. If there is a single scalar parameter to a matrix constructor, it is
        used to initialize all the components on the matrixâs diagonal, with the remaining components initialized
        to 0.0.
        If a vector is constructed from multiple scalars, one or more vectors, or one or more matrices, or a mixture
        of these, the vector's components will be constructed in order from the components of the arguments. The
        arguments will be consumed left to right, and each argument will have all its components consumed, in
        order, before any components from the next argument are consumed. Similarly for constructing a matrix
        from multiple scalars or vectors, or a mixture of these. Matrix components will be constructed and
        consumed in column major order. In these cases, there must be enough components provided in the
        arguments to provide an initializer for every component in the constructed value. It is a compile-time
        error to provide extra arguments beyond this last used argument.
        If a matrix is constructed from a matrix, then each component (column i, row j) in the result that has a
        corresponding component (column i, row j) in the argument will be initialized from there. All other
        components will be initialized to the identity matrix. If a matrix argument is given to a matrix constructor,
        it is a compile-time error to have any other arguments.
        If the basic type (bool, int, float, or double) of a parameter to a constructor does not match the basic type
        of the object being constructed, the scalar construction rules (above) are used to convert the parameters.

Some useful vector constructors are as follows:
   vec3(float)        // initializes each component of the vec3 with the float
   vec4(ivec4)        // makes a vec4 with component-wise conversion
   vec4(mat2)         // the vec4 is column 0 followed by column 1

   vec2(float, float)                              // initializes a vec2 with 2 floats
   ivec3(int, int, int)                            // initializes an ivec3 with 3 ints
   bvec4(int, int, float, float)                   // uses 4 Boolean conversions

   vec2(vec3)                   // drops the third component of a vec3
   vec3(vec4)                   // drops the fourth component of a vec4

   vec3(vec2, float)            // vec3.x = vec2.x, vec3.y = vec2.y, vec3.z = float
   vec3(float, vec2)            // vec3.x = float, vec3.y = vec2.x, vec3.z = vec2.y
   vec4(vec3, float)
   vec4(float, vec3)
   vec4(vec2, vec2)

Some examples of these are:
   vec4 color = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
   vec4 rgba = vec4(1.0);    // sets each component to 1.0
   vec3 rgb   = vec3(color); // drop the 4th component

To initialize the diagonal of a matrix with all other elements set to zero:
   mat2(float)
   mat3(float)
   mat4(float)

That is, result[i][j] is set to the float argument for all i = j and set to 0 for all iâ  j.

                                                                               5 Operators and Expressions



        To initialize a matrix by specifying vectors or scalars, the components are assigned to the matrix elements
        in column-major order.
           mat2(vec2, vec2);                         //   one   column   per   argument
           mat3(vec3, vec3, vec3);                   //   one   column   per   argument
           mat4(vec4, vec4, vec4, vec4);             //   one   column   per   argument
           mat3x2(vec2, vec2, vec2);                 //   one   column   per   argument

           dmat2(dvec2, dvec2);
           dmat3(dvec3, dvec3, dvec3);
           dmat4(dvec4, dvec4, dvec4, dvec4);

           mat2(float, float,               // first column
                float, float);              // second column

           mat3(float, float, float,                 // first column
                float, float, float,                 // second column
                float, float, float);                // third column

           mat4(float,      float,    float,   float,      //   first column
                float,      float,    float,   float,      //   second column
                float,      float,    float,   float,      //   third column
                float,      float,    float,   float);     //   fourth column

           mat2x3(vec2, float,                // first column
                  vec2, float);               // second column

           dmat2x4(dvec3, double,             // first column
                   double, dvec3)             // second column


        A wide range of other possibilities exist, to construct a matrix from vectors and scalars, as long as enough
        components are present to initialize the matrix. To construct a matrix from a matrix:
           mat3x3(mat4x4);         // takes the upper-left 3x3 of the mat4x4
           mat2x3(mat4x2);         // takes the upper-left 2x2 of the mat4x4, last row is 0,0
           mat4x4(mat3x3);         // puts the mat3x3 in the upper-left, sets the lower right
                                   //    component to 1, and the rest to 0

5.4.3   Structure Constructors
        Once a structure is defined, and its type is given a name, a constructor is available with the same name to
        construct instances of that structure. For example:
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           };

           light lightVar = light(3.0, vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0));




                                                      100
                                                                                5 Operators and Expressions



        The arguments to the constructor will be used to set the structure's members, in order, using one argument
        per member. Each argument must be the same type as the member it sets, or be a type that can be
        converted to the member's type according to section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversions.â
        Structure constructors can be used as initializers or in expressions.

5.4.4   Array Constructors
        Array types can also be used as constructor names, which can then be used in expressions or initializers.
        For example,

           const float c[3] = float[3](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);
           const float d[3] = float[](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);

           float g;
           ...
           float a[5] = float[5](g, 1, g, 2.3, g);
           float b[3];

           b = float[3](g, g + 1.0, g + 2.0);

        There must be exactly the same number of arguments as the size of the array being constructed. If no size
        is present in the constructor, then the array is explicitly sized to the number of arguments provided. The
        arguments are assigned in order, starting at element 0, to the elements of the constructed array. Each
        argument must be the same type as the element type of the array, or be a type that can be converted to the
        element type of the array according to section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversions.â
        Arrays of arrays are similarly constructed, but only the outer-most dimension is optional:
           vec4 b[2] = ...;
           vec4[3][2](b, b, b);                    // constructor
           vec4[][2](b, b, b);                     // constructor, valid, size deduced
           vec4[3][](b, b, b);                     // compile-time error, invalid type constructed

5.5     Vector and Scalar Components and Length
        The names of the components of a vector or scalar are denoted by a single letter. As a notational
        convenience, several letters are associated with each component based on common usage of position,
        color or texture coordinate vectors. The individual components can be selected by following the variable
        name with period ( . ) and then the component name.
        The component names supported are:

              {x, y, z, w}        Useful when accessing vectors that represent points or normals
              {r, g, b, a}              Useful when accessing vectors that represent colors
              {s, t, p, q}       Useful when accessing vectors that represent texture coordinates




                                                       101
                                                                     5 Operators and Expressions



The component names x, r, and s are, for example, synonyms for the same (first) component in a vector.
They are also the names of the only component in a scalar.
Note that the third component of the texture coordinate set, r in OpenGL, has been renamed p so as to
avoid the confusion with r (for red) in a color.
Accessing components beyond those declared for the type is a compile-time error so, for example:
   vec2 pos;
   float height;
   pos.x      // is legal
   pos.z      // is illegal
   height.x // is legal
   height.y // is illegal

The component selection syntax allows multiple components to be selected by appending their names
(from the same name set) after the period ( . ).
   vec4 v4;
   v4.rgba;      //   is   a vec4 and the same as just using v4,
   v4.rgb;       //   is   a vec3,
   v4.b;         //   is   a float,
   v4.xy;        //   is   a vec2,
   v4.xgba;      //   is   illegal - the component names do not come from
                 //                  the same set.

The order of the components can be different to swizzle them, or replicated:
   vec4 pos = vec4(1.0,         2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
   vec4 swiz= pos.wzyx;         // swiz = (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
   vec4 dup = pos.xxyy;         // dup = (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)
   float f = 1.2;
   vec4 dup = f.xxxx;           // dup = (1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2)

This notation is more concise than the constructor syntax. To form an r-value, it can be applied to any
expression that results in a vector or scalar r-value. Any resulting vector of any operation must be a valid
vector in the language; hence the following results in a compile-time error:
   vec4 f;
   vec4 g = pos.xyzwxy.xyzw;             // illegal; pos.xyzwxy is non-existent âvec6â

The component group notation can occur on the left hand side of an expression.
   vec4 pos     = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
   pos.xw =     vec2(5.0, 6.0);         // pos = (5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0)
   pos.wx =     vec2(7.0, 8.0);         // pos = (8.0, 2.0, 3.0, 7.0)
   pos.xx =     vec2(3.0, 4.0);         // illegal - 'x' used twice
   pos.xy =     vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);    // illegal - mismatch between vec2 and vec3

To form an l-value, swizzling must be applied to an l-value of vector or scalar type, contain no duplicate
components, and it results in an l-value of scalar or vector type, depending on number of components
specified.




                                              102
                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



      Array subscripting syntax can also be applied to vectors (but not to scalars) to provide numeric indexing.
      So in
         vec4       pos;

      pos[2] refers to the third element of pos and is equivalent to pos.z. This allows variable indexing into a
      vector, as well as a generic way of accessing components. Any integer expression can be used as the
      subscript. The first component is at index zero. Reading from or writing to a vector using a constant
      integral expression with a value that is negative or greater than or equal to the size of the vector results in
      a compile-time error. When indexing with non-constant expressions, behavior is undefined if the index is
      negative, or greater than or equal to the size of the vector.
      The length method may be applied to vectors (but not scalars). The result is the number of components in
      the vector. For example,
         vec3 v;
         const int L = v.length();

      sets the constant L to 3. The type returned by .length() on a vector is int, and the value returned is a
      constant expression.

5.6   Matrix Components
      The components of a matrix can be accessed using array subscripting syntax. Applying a single subscript
      to a matrix treats the matrix as an array of column vectors, and selects a single column, whose type is a
      vector of the same size as the matrix. The leftmost column is column 0. A second subscript would then
      operate on the resulting vector, as defined earlier for vectors. Hence, two subscripts select a column and
      then a row.
         mat4 m;
         m[1] = vec4(2.0);                   // sets the second column to all 2.0
         m[0][0] = 1.0;                      // sets the upper left element to 1.0
         m[2][3] = 2.0;                      // sets the 4th element of the third column to 2.0

      Behavior is undefined when accessing a component outside the bounds of a matrix with a non-constant
      expression. It is a compile-time error to access a matrix with a constant expression that is outside the
      bounds of the matrix.
      The length method may be applied to matrices. The result is the number of columns of the matrix. For
      example,
         mat3x4 v;
         const int L = v.length();

      sets the constant L to 3. The type returned by .length() on a matrix is int, and the value returned is a
      constant expression.

5.7   Structure and Array Operations
      The members of a structure and the length method of an array are selected using the period ( . ).




                                                      103
                                                                           5 Operators and Expressions



      In total, only the following operators are allowed to operate on arrays and structures as whole entities:

           field selector                 .
           equality                       == !=
           assignment                     =
           indexing (arrays only)         []


      The equality operators and assignment operator are only allowed if the two operands are same size and
      type. Structure types must be of the same declared structure. Both array operands must be explicitly
      sized. When using the equality operators, two structures are equal if and only if all the members are
      component-wise equal, and two arrays are equal if and only if all the elements are element-wise equal.
      Array elements are accessed using the array subscript operator ( [ ] ). An example of accessing an array
      element is
         diffuseColor += lightIntensity[3] * NdotL;

      Array indices start at zero. Array elements are accessed using an expression whose type is int or uint.
      Behavior is undefined if a shader subscripts an array with an index less than 0 or greater than or equal to
      the size the array was declared with.
      Arrays can also be accessed with the method operator ( . ) and the length method to query the size of the
      array:
         lightIntensity.length()               // return the size of the array



5.8   Assignments
      Assignments of values to variable names are done with the assignment operator ( = ):
         lvalue-expression = rvalue-expression

      The lvalue-expression evaluates to an l-value. The assignment operator stores the value of rvalue-
      expression into the l-value and returns an r-value with the type and precision of lvalue-expression. The
      lvalue-expression and rvalue-expression must have the same type, or the expression must have a type in
      the table in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that converts to the type of lvalue-expression, in which
      case an implicit conversion will be done on the rvalue-expression before the assignment is done. Any
      other desired type-conversions must be specified explicitly via a constructor. L-values must be writable.
      Variables that are built-in types, entire structures or arrays, structure members, l-values with the field
      selector ( . ) applied to select components or swizzles without repeated fields, l-values within parentheses,
      and l-values dereferenced with the array subscript operator ( [ ] ) are all l-values. Other binary or unary
      expressions, function names, swizzles with repeated fields, and constants cannot be l-values. The ternary
      operator (?:) is also not allowed as an l-value. Using an incorrect expression as an l-value results in a
      compile-time error.
      Expressions on the left of an assignment are evaluated before expressions on the right of the assignment.




                                                     104
                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



      The other assignment operators are
      â¢    add into (+=)
      â¢    subtract from (-=)
      â¢    multiply into (*=)
      â¢    divide into (/=)
      â¢    modulus into (%=)
      â¢    left shift by (<<=)
      â¢    right shift by (>>=)
      â¢    and into (&=)
      â¢    inclusive-or into (|=)
      â¢    exclusive-or into (^=)
      where the general expression

           lvalue op= expression

      is equivalent to

           lvalue = lvalue op expression

      where op is as described below, and the l-value and expression must satisfy the semantic requirements of
      both op and equals (=).
      Reading a variable before writing (or initializing) it is legal, however the value is undefined.

5.9   Expressions
      Expressions in the shading language are built from the following:
      â¢   Constants of type bool, all integer types, all floating-point types, all vector types, and all matrix types.
      â¢   Constructors of all types.
      â¢   Variable names of all types.
      â¢   An array, vector, or matrix expression with the length method applied.
      â¢   Subscripted array names.
      â¢   Function calls that return values.
      â¢   Component field selectors and array subscript results.
      â¢   Parenthesized expression. Any expression can be parenthesized. Parentheses can be used to group
          operations. Operations within parentheses are done before operations across parentheses.

                                                                      5 Operators and Expressions



â¢   The arithmetic binary operators add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) operate on integer and
    floating-point scalars, vectors, and matrices. If the fundamental types in the operands do not match,
    then the conversions from section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ are applied to create matching types.
    All arithmetic binary operators result in the same fundamental type (signed integer, unsigned integer,
    single-precision floating point, or double-precision floating point) as the operands they operate on,
    after operand type conversion. After conversion, the following cases are valid
    â¢   The two operands are scalars. In this case the operation is applied, resulting in a scalar.
    â¢   One operand is a scalar, and the other is a vector or matrix. In this case, the scalar operation is
        applied independently to each component of the vector or matrix, resulting in the same size vector
        or matrix.
    â¢   The two operands are vectors of the same size. In this case, the operation is done component-wise
        resulting in the same size vector.
    â¢   The operator is add (+), subtract (-), or divide (/), and the operands are matrices with the same
        number of rows and the same number of columns. In this case, the operation is done component-
        wise resulting in the same size matrix.
    â¢   The operator is multiply (*), where both operands are matrices or one operand is a vector and the
        other a matrix. A right vector operand is treated as a column vector and a left vector operand as a
        row vector. In all these cases, it is required that the number of columns of the left operand is equal
        to the number of rows of the right operand. Then, the multiply (*) operation does a linear
        algebraic multiply, yielding an object that has the same number of rows as the left operand and the
        same number of columns as the right operand. Section 5.10 âVector and Matrix Operationsâ
        explains in more detail how vectors and matrices are operated on.
    All other cases result in a compile-time error.
    Dividing by zero does not cause an exception but does result in an unspecified value. Use the built-in
    functions dot, cross, matrixCompMult, and outerProduct, to get, respectively, vector dot product,
    vector cross product, matrix component-wise multiplication, and the matrix product of a column
    vector times a row vector.
â¢   The operator modulus (%) operates on signed or unsigned integer scalars or integer vectors. If the
    fundamental types in the operands do not match, then the conversions from section 4.1.10 âImplicit
    Conversionsâ are applied to create matching types. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size;
    this is a compile time error. If one operand is a scalar and the other vector, then the scalar is applied
    component-wise to the vector, resulting in the same type as the vector. If both are vectors of the same
    size, the result is computed component-wise. The resulting value is undefined for any component
    computed with a second operand that is zero, while results for other components with non-zero second
    operands remain defined. If both operands are non-negative, then the remainder is non-negative.
    Results are undefined if one or both operands are negative. The operator modulus (%) is not defined
    for any other data types (non-integer types).
â¢   The arithmetic unary operators negate (-), post- and pre-increment and decrement (-- and ++) operate
    on integer or floating-point values (including vectors and matrices). All unary operators work
    component-wise on their operands. These result with the same type they operated on. For post- and
    pre-increment and decrement, the expression must be one that could be assigned to (an l-value). Pre-
    increment and pre-decrement add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents of the expression they operate on,




                                                106
                                                                       5 Operators and Expressions



    and the value of the pre-increment or pre-decrement expression is the resulting value of that
    modification. Post-increment and post-decrement expressions add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents
    of the expression they operate on, but the resulting expression has the expressionâs value before the
    post-increment or post-decrement was executed.
â¢   The relational operators greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal (>=), and less than or
    equal (<=) operate only on scalar integer and scalar floating-point expressions. The result is scalar
    Boolean. Either the operandsâ types must match, or the conversions from section 4.1.10 âImplicit
    Conversionsâ will be applied to obtain matching types. To do component-wise relational comparisons
    on vectors, use the built-in functions lessThan, lessThanEqual, greaterThan, and
    greaterThanEqual.
â¢   The equality operators equal (==), and not equal (!=) operate on all types. They result in a scalar
    Boolean. If the operand types do not match, then there must be a conversion from section 4.1.10
    âImplicit Conversionsâ applied to one operand that can make them match, in which case this
    conversion is done. For vectors, matrices, structures, and arrays, all components, members, or
    elements of one operand must equal the corresponding components, members, or elements in the other
    operand for the operands to be considered equal. To get a vector of component-wise equality results
    for vectors, use the built-in functions equal and notEqual.
â¢   The logical binary operators and (&&), or ( | | ), and exclusive or (^^) operate only on two Boolean
    expressions and result in a Boolean expression. And (&&) will only evaluate the right hand operand
    if the left hand operand evaluated to true. Or ( | | ) will only evaluate the right hand operand if the left
    hand operand evaluated to false. Exclusive or (^^) will always evaluate both operands.
â¢   The logical unary operator not (!). It operates only on a Boolean expression and results in a Boolean
    expression. To operate on a vector, use the built-in function not.
â¢   The sequence ( , ) operator that operates on expressions by returning the type and value of the right-
    most expression in a comma separated list of expressions. All expressions are evaluated, in order,
    from left to right.
â¢   The ternary selection operator (?:). It operates on three expressions (exp1 ? exp2 : exp3). This
    operator evaluates the first expression, which must result in a scalar Boolean. If the result is true, it
    selects to evaluate the second expression, otherwise it selects to evaluate the third expression. Only
    one of the second and third expressions is evaluated. The second and third expressions can be any
    type, as long their types match, or there is a conversion in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that
    can be applied to one of the expressions to make their types match. This resulting matching type is the
    type of the entire expression.
â¢   The one's complement operator (~). The operand must be of type signed or unsigned integer or integer
    vector, and the result is the one's complement of its operand; each bit of each component is
    complemented, including any sign bits.
â¢   The shift operators (<<) and (>>). For both operators, the operands must be signed or unsigned
    integers or integer vectors. One operand can be signed while the other is unsigned. In all cases, the
    resulting type will be the same type as the left operand. If the first operand is a scalar, the second
    operand has to be a scalar as well. If the first operand is a vector, the second operand must be a scalar
    or a vector, and the result is computed component-wise. The result is undefined if the right operand is
    negative, or greater than or equal to the number of bits in the left expression's base type. The value of
    E1 << E2 is E1 (interpreted as a bit pattern) left-shifted by E2 bits. The value of E1 >> E2 is E1 right-




                                                107
                                                                               5 Operators and Expressions



           shifted by E2 bit positions. If E1 is a signed integer, the right-shift will extend the sign bit. If E1 is an
           unsigned integer, the right-shift will zero-extend.
       â¢   The bitwise operators and (&), exclusive-or (^), and inclusive-or (|). The operands must be of type
           signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size; this is
           a compile-time error. If one operand is a scalar and the other a vector, the scalar is applied
           component-wise to the vector, resulting in the same type as the vector. The fundamental types of the
           operands (signed or unsigned) must match, and will be the resulting fundamental type. For and (&),
           the result is the bitwise-and function of the operands. For exclusive-or (^), the result is the bitwise
           exclusive-or function of the operands. For inclusive-or (|), the result is the bitwise inclusive-or
           function of the operands.
       For a complete specification of the syntax of expressions, see section 9 âShading Language Grammar.â

5.10   Vector and Matrix Operations
       With a few exceptions, operations are component-wise. Usually, when an operator operates on a vector or
       matrix, it is operating independently on each component of the vector or matrix, in a component-wise
       fashion. For example,
           vec3 v, u;
           float f;

           v = u + f;

       will be equivalent to
           v.x = u.x + f;
           v.y = u.y + f;
           v.z = u.z + f;

       And
           vec3 v, u, w;
           w = v + u;

       will be equivalent to
           w.x = v.x + u.x;
           w.y = v.y + u.y;
           w.z = v.z + u.z;

       and likewise for most operators and all integer and floating-point vector and matrix types. The exceptions
       are matrix multiplied by vector, vector multiplied by matrix, and matrix multiplied by matrix. These do
       not operate component-wise, but rather perform the correct linear algebraic multiply.
           vec3 v, u;
           mat3 m;

           u = v * m;

       is equivalent to




                                                        108
                                                                              5 Operators and Expressions



          u.x = dot(v, m[0]); // m[0] is the left column of m
          u.y = dot(v, m[1]); // dot(a,b) is the inner (dot) product of a and b
          u.z = dot(v, m[2]);

       And
          u = m * v;

       is equivalent to
          u.x = m[0].x * v.x          +   m[1].x * v.y          +   m[2].x * v.z;
          u.y = m[0].y * v.x          +   m[1].y * v.y          +   m[2].y * v.z;
          u.z = m[0].z * v.x          +   m[1].z * v.y          +   m[2].z * v.z;

       And
          mat3 m, n, r;

          r = m * n;

       is equivalent to
          r[0].x = m[0].x * n[0].x             +   m[1].x * n[0].y        +    m[2].x * n[0].z;
          r[1].x = m[0].x * n[1].x             +   m[1].x * n[1].y        +    m[2].x * n[1].z;
          r[2].x = m[0].x * n[2].x             +   m[1].x * n[2].y        +    m[2].x * n[2].z;

          r[0].y = m[0].y * n[0].x             +   m[1].y * n[0].y        +    m[2].y * n[0].z;
          r[1].y = m[0].y * n[1].x             +   m[1].y * n[1].y        +    m[2].y * n[1].z;
          r[2].y = m[0].y * n[2].x             +   m[1].y * n[2].y        +    m[2].y * n[2].z;

          r[0].z = m[0].z * n[0].x             +   m[1].z * n[0].y        +    m[2].z * n[0].z;
          r[1].z = m[0].z * n[1].x             +   m[1].z * n[1].y        +    m[2].z * n[1].z;
          r[2].z = m[0].z * n[2].x             +   m[1].z * n[2].y        +    m[2].z * n[2].z;

       and similarly for other sizes of vectors and matrices.

5.11   Out-of-Bounds Accesses
       In the subsections described above for array, vector, matrix and structure accesses, any out-of-bounds
       access produced undefined behavior. However, if robust buffer access is enabled via the OpenGL API,
       such accesses will be bound within the memory extent of the active program. It will not be possible to
       access memory from other programs, and accesses will not result in abnormal program termination. Out-
       of-bounds reads return undefined values, which include values from other variables of the active program
       or zero. Out-of-bounds writes may be discarded or overwrite other variables of the active program,
       depending on the value of the computed index and how this relates to the extent of the active program's
       memory. Applications that require defined behavior for out-of-bounds accesses should range check all
       computed indices before dereferencing an array.

6 Statements and Structure

   The fundamental building blocks of the OpenGL Shading Language are:
   â¢   statements and declarations
   â¢   function definitions
   â¢   selection (if-else and switch-case-default)
   â¢   iteration (for, while, and do-while)
   â¢   jumps (discard, return, break, and continue)


   The overall structure of a shader is as follows

        translation-unit:
             global-declaration
             translation-unit global-declaration
        global-declaration:
            function-definition
            declaration
   That is, a shader is a sequence of declarations and function bodies. Function bodies are defined as

        function-definition:
             function-prototype { statement-list }
        statement-list:
             statement
             statement-list statement
        statement:
             compound-statement
             simple-statement




                                                   110
                                                                            6 Statements and Structure



      Curly braces are used to group sequences of statements into compound statements.

           compound-statement:
               { statement-list }
           simple-statement:
               declaration-statement
               expression-statement
               selection-statement
               iteration-statement
               jump-statement


      Simple declaration, expression, and jump statements end in a semi-colon.
      This above is slightly simplified, and the complete grammar specified in section 9 âShading Language
      Grammarâ should be used as the definitive specification.
      Declarations and expressions have already been discussed.

6.1   Function Definitions
      As indicated by the grammar above, a valid shader is a sequence of global declarations and function
      definitions. A function is declared as the following example shows:
         // prototype
         returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn);

      and a function is defined like
         // definition
         returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
         {
             // do some computation
             return returnValue;
         }

      where returnType must be present and include a type. If the type of returnValue does not match
      returnType, there must be an implicit conversion in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that converts
      the type of returnValue to returnType, or a compile-time error will result.
      Each of the typeN must include a type and can optionally include parameter qualifiers. The formal
      argument names (args above) in the declarations are optional for both the declaration and definition
      forms.
      A function is called by using its name followed by a list of arguments in parentheses.
      Arrays are allowed as arguments and as the return type. In both cases, the array must be explicitly sized.
      An array is passed or returned by using just its name, without brackets, and the size of the array must
      match the size specified in the function's declaration.
      Structures are also allowed as argument types. The return type can also be structure.




                                                    111
                                                                       6 Statements and Structure



See section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive reference on the syntax to declare and
define functions.
All functions must be either declared with a prototype or defined with a body before they are called. For
example:
    float myfunc (float f,                    // f is an input parameter
                  out float g);               // g is an output parameter


Functions that return no value must be declared as void. A void function can only use return without a
return argument, even if the return argument has void type. Return statements only accept values:
    void func1() { }
    void func2() { return func1(); } // illegal return statement

Only a precision qualifier is allowed on the return type of a function. Formal parameters can have
parameter, precision, and memory qualifiers, but no other qualifiers.
Functions that accept no input arguments need not use void in the argument list because prototypes (or
definitions) are required and therefore there is no ambiguity when an empty argument list "( )" is declared.
The idiom â(void)â as a parameter list is provided for convenience.
Function names can be overloaded. The same function name can be used for multiple functions, as long
as the parameter types differ. If a function name is declared twice with the same parameter types, then the
return types and all qualifiers must also match, and it is the same function being declared. For example,
    vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y);                      // (A)
    vec4 f(in vec4 x, out uvec4 y);                     // (B) okay, different argument type
    vec4 f(in ivec4 x, out dvec4 y);                    // (C) okay, different argument type

    int f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y);        // error, only return type differs
    vec4 f(in vec4 x, in vec4 y);        // error, only qualifier differs
    vec4 f(const in vec4 x, out vec4 y); // error, only qualifier differs

When function calls are resolved, an exact type match for all the arguments is sought. If an exact match is
found, all other functions are ignored, and the exact match is used. If no exact match is found, then the
implicit conversions in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ will be applied to find a match.
Mismatched types on input parameters (in or inout or default) must have a conversion from the calling
argument type to the formal parameter type. Mismatched types on output parameters (out or inout) must
have a conversion from the formal parameter type to the calling argument type.
If implicit conversions can be used to find more than one matching function, a single best-matching
function is sought. To determine a best match, the conversions between calling argument and formal
parameter types are compared for each function argument and pair of matching functions. After these
comparisons are performed, each pair of matching functions are compared. A function declaration A is
considered a better match than function declaration B if
â¢   for at least one function argument, the conversion for that argument in A is better than the
    corresponding conversion in B; and




                                                112
                                                                           6 Statements and Structure



â¢   there is no function argument for which the conversion in B is better than the corresponding
    conversion in A.
If a single function declaration is considered a better match than every other matching function
declaration, it will be used. Otherwise, a compile-time semantic error for an ambiguous overloaded
function call occurs.
To determine whether the conversion for a single argument in one match is better than that for another
match, the following rules are applied, in order:
    1.   An exact match is better than a match involving any implicit conversion.
    2.   A match involving an implicit conversion from float to double is better than a match involving
         any other implicit conversion.
    3.   A match involving an implicit conversion from either int or uint to float is better than a match
         involving an implicit conversion from either int or uint to double.
If none of the rules above apply to a particular pair of conversions, neither conversion is considered better
than the other.
For the example function prototypes (A), (B), and (C) above, the following examples show how the rules
apply to different sets of calling argument types:
    f(vec4, vec4);                  //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y)
    f(vec4, uvec4);                 //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out uvec4 y)
    f(vec4, ivec4);                 //   matched to vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y)
                                    //     (C) not relevant, can't convert vec4 to
                                    //     ivec4. (A) better than (B) for 2nd
                                    //     argument (rule 3), same on first argument.
    f(ivec4, vec4);                 //   NOT matched. All three match by implicit
                                    //     conversion. (C) is better than (A) and (B)
                                    //     on the first argument. (A) is better than
                                    //     (B) and (C).

User-defined functions can have multiple declarations, but only one definition. A shader can redefine
built-in functions. If a built-in function is redeclared in a shader (i.e., a prototype is visible) before a call
to it, then the linker will only attempt to resolve that call within the set of shaders that are linked with it.
The function main is used as the entry point to a shader executable. A shader need not contain a function
named main, but one shader in a set of shaders linked together to form a single shader executable must, or
a link-time error results. This function takes no arguments, returns no value, and must be declared as type
void:
    void main()
    {
        ...
    }

The function main can contain uses of return. See section 6.4 âJumpsâ for more details.
It is a compile-time or link-time error to declare or define a function main with any other parameters or
return type.

6.1.1   Function Calling Conventions
        Functions are called by value-return. This means input arguments are copied into the function at call time,
        and output arguments are copied back to the caller before function exit. Because the function works with
        local copies of parameters, there are no issues regarding aliasing of variables within a function. To
        control what parameters are copied in and/or out through a function definition or declaration:
        â¢   The keyword in is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied in, but not copied out.
        â¢   The keyword out is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied out, but not copied in.
            This should be used whenever possible to avoid unnecessarily copying parameters in.
        â¢   The keyword inout is used as a qualifier to denote the parameter is to be both copied in and copied
            out. It means the same thing as specifying both in and out.
        â¢   A function parameter declared with no such qualifier means the same thing as specifying in.
        All arguments are evaluated at call time, exactly once, in order, from left to right. Evaluation of an in
        parameter results in a value that is copied to the formal parameter. Evaluation of an out parameter results
        in an l-value that is used to copy out a value when the function returns. Evaluation of an inout parameter
        results in both a value and an l-value; the value is copied to the formal parameter at call time and the l-
        value is used to copy out a value when the function returns.
        The order in which output parameters are copied back to the caller is undefined.
        If the function matching described in the previous section required argument type conversions, these
        conversions are applied at copy-in and copy-out times.
        In a function, writing to an input-only parameter is allowed. Only the functionâs copy is modified. This
        can be prevented by declaring a parameter with the const qualifier.
        When calling a function, expressions that do not evaluate to l-values cannot be passed to parameters

                  precision-qualifier type function-name(parameter-qualifiers precision-qualifier type name
                  array-specifier, ... )

        The const qualifier cannot be used with out or inout, or a compile-time error results. The above is used
        both for function declarations (i.e., prototypes) and for function definitions. Hence, function definitions
        can have unnamed arguments.
        Recursion is not allowed, not even statically. Static recursion is present if the static function-call graph of
        a program contains cycles. This includes all potential function calls through variables declared as
        subroutine uniform (described below). It is a compile-time or link-time error if a single compilation
        unit (shader) contains either static recursion or the potential for recursion through subroutine variables.

6.1.2   Subroutines
        Subroutines provide a mechanism allowing shaders to be compiled in a manner where the target of one or
        more function calls can be changed at run-time without requiring any shader recompilation. For example,
        a single shader may be compiled with support for multiple illumination algorithms to handle different
        kinds of lights or surface materials. An application using such a shader may switch illumination
        algorithms by changing the value of its subroutine uniforms. To use subroutines, a subroutine type is
        declared, one or more functions are associated with that subroutine type, and a subroutine variable of that
        type is declared. The function currently assigned to the variable function is then called by using function
        calling syntax replacing a function name with the name of the subroutine variable. Subroutine variables




                                                        115
                                                                              6 Statements and Structure



      are uniforms, and are assigned to specific functions only through commands (UniformSubroutinesuiv) in
      the OpenGL API.
      Subroutine types are declared using a statement similar to a function declaration, with the subroutine
      keyword, as follows:
         subroutine returnType subroutineTypeName(type0 arg0, type1 arg1,
                                                  ..., typen argn);

      As with function declarations, the formal argument names (args above) are optional. Functions are
      associated with subroutine types of matching declarations by defining the function with the subroutine
      keyword and a list of subroutine types the function matches:
         subroutine(subroutineTypeName0, ..., subroutineTypeNameN)
         returnType functionName(type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
         { ... } // function body

      It is a compile-time error if arguments and return type don't match between the function and each
      associated subroutine type.
      Functions declared with subroutine must include a body. An overloaded function cannot be declared
      with subroutine; a program will fail to compile or link if any shader or stage contains two or more
      functions with the same name if the name is associated with a subroutine type.
      A function declared with subroutine can also be called directly with a static use of functionName, as is
      done with non-subroutine function declarations and calls.
      Subroutine type variables are required to be subroutine uniforms, and are declared with a specific
      subroutine type in a subroutine uniform variable declaration:
         subroutine uniform subroutineTypeName subroutineVarName;

      Subroutine uniform variables are called the same way functions are called. When a subroutine variable
      (or an element of a subroutine variable array) is associated with a particular function, all function calls
      through that variable will call that particular function.
      Unlike other uniform variables, subroutine uniform variables are scoped to the shader execution stage the
      variable is declared in.
      Subroutine variables may be declared as explicitly-sized arrays, which can be indexed only with
      dynamically uniform expressions.

6.2   Selection
      Conditional control flow in the shading language is done by either if, if-else, or switch statements:
           selection-statement :
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement else statement
                 switch ( init-expression ) { switch-statement-listopt }
      Where switch-statement-list is a list of zero or more switch-statement and other statements defined by the
      language, where switch-statement adds some forms of labels. That is




                                                     116
                                                                               6 Statements and Structure



           switch-statement-list :
                switch-statement
                switch-statement-list switch-statement
           switch-statement :
                case constant-expression :
                default :
                statement

      If an if-expression evaluates to true, then the first statement is executed. If it evaluates to false and there
      is an else part then the second statement is executed.
      Any expression whose type evaluates to a Boolean can be used as the conditional expression bool-
      expression. Vector types are not accepted as the expression to if.
      Conditionals can be nested.
      The type of the init-expression value in a switch statement must be a scalar int or uint. The type of the
      constant-expression value in a case label also must be a scalar int or uint. When any pair of these values
      is tested for "equal value" and the types do not match, an implicit conversion will be done to convert the
      int to a uint (see section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ) before the compare is done. If a case label has a
      constant-expression of equal value to init-expression, execution will continue after that label. It is a
      compile-time error to have two case label constant-expression of equal value. Otherwise, if there is a
      default label, execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, execution skips the rest of the switch
      statement. It is a compile-time error to have more than one default. A break statement not nested in a
      loop or other switch statement (either not nested or nested only in if or if-else statements) will also skip
      the rest of the switch statement. Fall through labels are allowed, but it is a compile-time error to have no
      statement between a label and the end of the switch statement. No statements are allowed in a switch
      statement before the first case statement.
      No case or default labels can be nested inside other flow control nested within their corresponding
      switch.

6.3   Iteration
      For, while, and do loops are allowed as follows:
         for (init-expression; condition-expression; loop-expression)
             sub-statement

         while (condition-expression)
             sub-statement

         do
             statement
         while (condition-expression)

      See section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive specification of loops.
      The for loop first evaluates the init-expression, then the condition-expression. If the condition-
      expression evaluates to true, then the body of the loop is executed. After the body is executed, a for loop




                                                      117
                                                                             6 Statements and Structure



      will then evaluate the loop-expression, and then loop back to evaluate the condition-expression, repeating
      until the condition-expression evaluates to false. The loop is then exited, skipping its body and skipping
      its loop-expression. Variables modified by the loop-expression maintain their value after the loop is
      exited, provided they are still in scope. Variables declared in init-expression or condition-expression are
      only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the for loop.
      The while loop first evaluates the condition-expression. If true, then the body is executed. This is then
      repeated, until the condition-expression evaluates to false, exiting the loop and skipping its body.
      Variables declared in the condition-expression are only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the
      while loop.
      The do-while loop first executes the body, then executes the condition-expression. This is repeated until
      condition-expression evaluates to false, and then the loop is exited.
      Expressions for condition-expression must evaluate to a Boolean.
      Both the condition-expression and the init-expression can declare and initialize a variable, except in the
      do-while loop, which cannot declare a variable in its condition-expression. The variableâs scope lasts
      only until the end of the sub-statement that forms the body of the loop.
      Loops can be nested.
      Non-terminating loops are allowed. The consequences of very long or non-terminating loops are platform
      dependent.

6.4   Jumps
      These are the jumps:

           jump_statement:
               continue;
               break;
               return;
               return expression;
               discard;    // in the fragment shader language only


      There is no âgotoâ nor other non-structured flow of control.
      The continue jump is used only in loops. It skips the remainder of the body of the inner most loop of
      which it is inside. For while and do-while loops, this jump is to the next evaluation of the loop
      condition-expression from which the loop continues as previously defined. For for loops, the jump is to
      the loop-expression, followed by the condition-expression.
      The break jump can also be used only in loops and switch statements. It is simply an immediate exit of
      the inner-most loop or switch statements containing the break. No further execution of condition-
      expression, loop-expression, or switch-statement is done.
      The discard keyword is only allowed within fragment shaders. It can be used within a fragment shader to
      abandon the operation on the current fragment. This keyword causes the fragment to be discarded and no
      updates to any buffers will occur. Control flow exits the shader, and subsequent implicit or explicit




                                                    118
                                                                      6 Statements and Structure



derivatives are undefined when this exit is non-uniform. It would typically be used within a conditional
statement, for example:
   if (intensity < 0.0)
       discard;

A fragment shader may test a fragmentâs alpha value and discard the fragment based on that test.
However, it should be noted that coverage testing occurs after the fragment shader runs, and the coverage
test can change the alpha value.
The return jump causes immediate exit of the current function. If it has expression then that is the return
value for the function.
The function main can use return. This simply causes main to exit in the same way as when the end of
the function had been reached. It does not imply a use of discard in a fragment shader. Using return in
main before defining outputs will have the same behavior as reaching the end of main before defining
outputs.

7 Built-in Variables

7.1   Built-In Language Variables
      Some OpenGL operations occur in fixed functionality and need to provide values to or receive values
      from shader executables. Shaders communicate with fixed-function OpenGL pipeline stages, and
      optionally with other shader executables, through the use of built-in input and output variables.
      In the compute language, the built-in variables are declared as follows:
         // work group dimensions
         in    uvec3 gl_NumWorkGroups;
         const uvec3 gl_WorkGroupSize;

         // work group and invocation IDs
         in    uvec3 gl_WorkGroupID;
         in    uvec3 gl_LocalInvocationID;

         // derived variables
         in    uvec3 gl_GlobalInvocationID;
         in    uint gl_LocalInvocationIndex;

      In the vertex language, the built-ins are intrinsically declared as:
         in    int      gl_VertexID;
         in    int      gl_InstanceID;

         out gl_PerVertex {
             vec4 gl_Position;
             float gl_PointSize;
             float gl_ClipDistance[];
         };




                                                      120
                                                                                      7 Built-in Variables



In the geometry language, the built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_in[];

   in int gl_PrimitiveIDIn;
   in int gl_InvocationID;

   out gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   };

   out int gl_PrimitiveID;
   out int gl_Layer;
   out int gl_ViewportIndex;

In the tessellation control language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_in[gl_MaxPatchVertices];

   in int gl_PatchVerticesIn;
   in int gl_PrimitiveID;
   in int gl_InvocationID;

   out gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_out[];

   patch out float gl_TessLevelOuter[4];
   patch out float gl_TessLevelInner[2];

In the tessellation evaluation language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_in[gl_MaxPatchVertices];

   in int gl_PatchVerticesIn;




                                                121
                                                                                   7 Built-in Variables



   in int gl_PrimitiveID;
   in vec3 gl_TessCoord;
   patch in float gl_TessLevelOuter[4];
   patch in float gl_TessLevelInner[2];

   out gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   };


In the fragment language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in    vec4    gl_FragCoord;
   in    bool    gl_FrontFacing;
   in    float   gl_ClipDistance[];
   in    vec2    gl_PointCoord;
   in    int     gl_PrimitiveID;
   in    int     gl_SampleID;
   in    vec2    gl_SamplePosition;
   in    int     gl_SampleMaskIn[];
   in    int     gl_Layer;
   in    int     gl_ViewportIndex;

   out float gl_FragDepth;
   out int   gl_SampleMask[];

Each of the above variables is discussed below.
The built-in variable gl_NumWorkGroups is a compute-shader input variable containing the total number
of global work items in each dimension of the work group that will execute the compute shader. Its
content is equal to the values specified in the num_groups_x, num_groups_y, and num_groups_z
parameters passed to the DispatchCompute API entry point.
The built-in constant gl_WorkGroupSize is a compute-shader constant containing the local work-group
size of the shader. The size of the work group in the X, Y, and Z dimensions is stored in the x, y, and z
components. The constants values in gl_WorkGroupSize will match those specified in the required
local_size_x, local_size_y, and local_size_z layout qualifiers for the current shader. This is a constant so
that it can be used to size arrays of memory that can be shared within the local work group. It is a
compile-time error to use gl_WorkGroupSize in a shader that does not declare a fixed local group size, or
before that shader has declared a fixed local group size, using local_size_x, local_size_y, and
local_size_z. When a size is given for some of these identifiers, but not all, the corresponding
gl_WorkGroupSize will have a size of 1.
The built-in variable gl_WorkGroupID is a compute-shader input variable containing the three-
dimensional index of the global work group that the current invocation is executing in. The possible
values range across the parameters passed into DispatchCompute, i.e., from (0, 0, 0) to
(gl_NumWorkGroups.x - 1, gl_NumWorkGroups.y - 1, gl_NumWorkGroups.z -1).




                                               122
                                                                                    7 Built-in Variables



The built-in variable gl_LocalInvocationID is a compute-shader input variable containing the t-
dimensional index of the local work group within the global work group that the current invocation is
executing in. The possible values for this variable range across the local work group size, i.e., (0,0,0) to
(gl_WorkGroupSize.x - 1, gl_WorkGroupSize.y - 1, gl_WorkGroupSize.z - 1).
The built-in variable gl_GlobalInvocationID is a compute shader input variable containing the global
index of the current work item. This value uniquely identifies this invocation from all other invocations
across all local and global work groups initiated by the current DispatchCompute call. This is computed
as:
   gl_GlobalInvocationID =
            gl_WorkGroupID * gl_WorkGroupSize + gl_LocalInvocationID;

The built-in variable gl_LocalInvocationIndex is a compute shader input variable that contains the one-
dimensional representation of the gl_LocalInvocationID. This is useful for uniquely identifying a unique
region of shared memory within the local work group for this invocation to use. This is computed as:
   gl_LocalInvocationIndex =
            gl_LocalInvocationID.z * gl_WorkGroupSize.x * gl_WorkGroupSize.y +
            gl_LocalInvocationID.y * gl_WorkGroupSize.x +
            gl_LocalInvocationID.x;

The variable gl_VertexID is a vertex language input variable that holds an integer index for the vertex, as
defined under âShader Inputsâ in section 11.1.3.9 âShader Inputsâ in the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification. While the variable gl_VertexID is always present, its value is not always defined.
The variable gl_InstanceID is a vertex language input variable that holds the instance number of the
current primitive in an instanced draw call (see âShader Inputsâ in section 11.1.3.9 âShader Inputsâ in the
OpenGL Graphics System Specification). If the current primitive does not come from an instanced draw
call, the value of gl_InstanceID is zero.
As an output variable, gl_Position is intended for writing the homogeneous vertex position. It can be
written at any time during shader execution. This value will be used by primitive assembly, clipping,
culling, and other fixed functionality operations, if present, that operate on primitives after vertex
processing has occurred. Its value is undefined after the vertex processing stage if the vertex shader
executable does not write gl_Position, and it is undefined after geometry processing if the geometry
executable calls EmitVertex() without having written gl_Position since the last EmitVertex() (or hasn't
written it at all). As an input variable, gl_Position reads the output written in the previous shader stage to
gl_Position.
As an output variable, gl_PointSize is intended for a shader to write the size of the point to be rasterized.
It is measured in pixels. If gl_PointSize is not written to, its value is undefined in subsequent pipe stages.
As an input variable, gl_PointSize reads the output written in the previous shader stage to gl_PointSize .
The variable gl_ClipDistance provides the forward compatible mechanism for controlling user clipping.
The element gl_ClipDistance[i] specifies a clip distance for each plane i. A distance of 0 means the
vertex is on the plane, a positive distance means the vertex is inside the clip plane, and a negative distance
means the point is outside the clip plane. The clip distances will be linearly interpolated across the
primitive and the portion of the primitive with interpolated distances less than 0 will be clipped.




                                               123
                                                                                  7 Built-in Variables



The gl_ClipDistance array is predeclared as unsized and must be sized by the shader either redeclaring it
with a size or indexing it only with integral constant expressions. This needs to size the array to include
all the clip planes that are enabled via the OpenGL API; if the size does not include all enabled planes,
results are undefined. The size can be at most gl_MaxClipDistances. The number of varying components
(see gl_MaxVaryingComponents) consumed by gl_ClipDistance will match the size of the array, no
matter how many planes are enabled. The shader must also set all values in gl_ClipDistance that have
been enabled via the OpenGL API, or results are undefined. Values written into gl_ClipDistance for
planes that are not enabled have no effect.
As an output variable, gl_ClipDistance provides the place for the shader to write these distances. As an
input in all but the fragment language, it reads the values written in the previous shader stage. In the
fragment language, gl_ClipDistance array contains linearly interpolated values for the vertex values
written by a shader to the gl_ClipDistance vertex output variable. Only elements in this array that have
clipping enabled will have defined values.
The output variable gl_PrimitiveID is available only in the geometry language and provides a single
integer that serves as a primitive identifier. This is then available to fragment shaders as the fragment
input gl_PrimitiveID, which will select the written primitive ID from the provoking vertex in the primitive
being shaded. If a fragment shader using gl_PrimitiveID is active and a geometry shader is also active,
the geometry shader must write to gl_PrimitiveID or the fragment shader input gl_PrimitiveID is
undefined. See section 11.3.4.5 "Geometry Shader Outputs" of the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification for more information.
For tessellation control and evaluation languages the input variable gl_PrimitiveID is filled with the
number of primitives processed by the shader since the current set of rendering primitives was started.
For the fragment language, it is filled with the value written to the gl_PrimitiveID geometry shader output
if a geometry shader is present. Otherwise, it is assigned in the same manner as with tessellation control
and evaluation shaders.
The geometry language input variable gl_PrimitiveIDIn behaves identically to the tessellation control and
evaluation language input variable gl_PrimitiveID.
The input variable gl_InvocationID is available only in the tessellation control and geometry languages.
In the tessellation control shader, it identifies the number of the output patch vertex assigned to the
tessellation control shader invocation. In the geometry shader, it identifies the invocation number
assigned to the geometry shader invocation. In both cases, gl_InvocationID is assigned integer values in
the range [0, N-1], where N is the number of output patch vertices or geometry shader invocations per
primitive.
The variable gl_Layer is available as an output variable in the geometry language and an input variable in
the fragment language. In the geometry language, it is used to select a specific layer (or face and layer of
a cube map) of a multi-layer framebuffer attachment. The actual layer used will come from one of the
vertices in the primitive being shaded. Which vertex the layer comes from is discussed in section 11.3.4.6
âLayer and Viewport Selectionâ of the OpenGL Specification. It might be undefined, so it is best to write
the same layer value for all vertices of a primitive. If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_Layer,
layered rendering mode is enabled. See section 11.3.4.5 âGeometry Shader Outputsâand section 9.4.9
âLayered Framebuffersâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification for more information. If a shader
statically assigns a value to gl_Layer, and there is an execution path through the shader that does not set
gl_Layer, then the value of gl_Layer is undefined for executions of the shader that take that path.

The output variable gl_Layer takes on a special value when used with an array of cube map textures.
Instead of only referring to the layer, it is used to select a cube map face and a layer. Setting gl_Layer to
the value layer*6+face will render to face face of the cube defined in layer layer. The face values are
defined in Table 9.3 of section 9.4.9 âLayered Framebuffersâ of the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification, but repeated below for clarity.

               Face Value                      Resulting Target
                     0             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X
                     1             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X
                     2             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y
                     3             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y
                     4             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z
                     5             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z

For example, to render to the positive y cube map face located in the 5th layer of the cube map array,
gl_Layer should be set to 5*6+2.
The input variable gl_Layer in the fragment language will have the same value that was written to the
output variable gl_Layer in the geometry language. If the geometry stage does not dynamically assign a
value to gl_Layer, the value of gl_Layer in the fragment stage will be undefined. If the geometry stage
makes no static assignment to gl_Layer, the input value in the fragment stage will be zero. Otherwise, the
fragment stage will read the same value written by the geometry stage, even if that value is out of range.
If a fragment shader contains a static access to gl_Layer, it will count against the implementation defined
limit for the maximum number of inputs to the fragment stage.
The variable gl_ViewportIndex is available as an output variable in the geometry language and an input
variable in the fragment language. In the geometry language, it provides the index of the viewport to
which the next primitive emitted from the geometry shader should be drawn. Primitives generated by
the geometry shader will undergo viewport transformation and scissor testing using the viewport
transformation and scissor rectangle selected by the value of gl_ViewportIndex. The viewport index used
will come from one of the vertices in the primitive being shaded. However, which vertex the viewport
index comes from is implementation-dependent, so it is best to use the same viewport index for all
vertices of the primitive. If a geometry shader does not assign a value to gl_ViewportIndex, viewport
transform and scissor rectangle zero will be used. If a geometry shader statically assigns a value to
gl_ViewportIndex and there is a path through the shader that does not assign a value to gl_ViewportIndex,
the value of gl_ViewportIndex is undefined for executions of the shader that take that path. See section
11.3.4.6 âLayer and Viewport Selectionâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification (Core Profile) for
more information.
The input variable gl_ViewportIndex in the fragment stage will have the same value that was written to the
output variable gl_ViewportIndex in the geometry stage. If the geometry stage does not dynamically
assign to gl_ViewportIndex, the value of gl_ViewportIndex in the fragment shader will be undefined. If
the geometry stage makes no static assignment to gl_ViewportIndex, the fragment stage will read zero.
Otherwise, the fragment stage will read the same value written by the geometry stage, even if that value is

out of range. If a fragment shader contains a static access to gl_ViewportIndex, it will count against the
implementation defined limit for the maximum number of inputs to the fragment stage.
The variable gl_PatchVerticesIn is available only in the tessellation control and evaluation languages. It
is an integer specifying the number of vertices in the input patch being processed by the shader. A single
tessellation control or evaluation shader can read patches of differing sizes, so the value of
gl_PatchVerticesIn may differ between patches.
The output variables gl_TessLevelOuter[] and gl_TessLevelInner[] are available only in the tessellation
control language. The values written to these variables are assigned to the corresponding outer and inner
tessellation levels of the output patch. They are used by the tessellation primitive generator to control
primitive tessellation and may be read by tessellation evaluation shaders.
The variable gl_TessCoord is available only in the tessellation evaluation language. It specifies a three-
component (u,v,w) vector identifying the position of the vertex being processed by the shader relative to
the primitive being tessellated. Its values will obey the properties
   gl_TessCoord.x == 1.0 â (1.0 â gl_TessCoord.x) // two operations performed
   gl_TessCoord.y == 1.0 â (1.0 â gl_TessCoord.y) // two operations performed
   gl_TessCoord.z == 1.0 â (1.0 â gl_TessCoord.z) // two operations performed

to aid in replicating subdivision computations.
The input variables gl_TessLevelOuter[] and gl_TessLevelInner[] are available only in the tessellation
evaluation shader. If a tessellation control shader is active, these variables are filled with corresponding
outputs written by the tessellation control shader. Otherwise, they are assigned with default tessellation
levels specified in section 11.2.3.3 âTessellation Evaluation Shader Inputsâ in the OpenGL Graphics
System Specification.
Fragment shaders output values to the OpenGL pipeline using declared out variables, the built-in
variables gl_FragDepth and gl_SampleMask, unless the discard statement is executed.
The fixed functionality computed depth for a fragment may be obtained by reading gl_FragCoord.z,
described below.
Writing to gl_FragDepth will establish the depth value for the fragment being processed. If depth
buffering is enabled, and no shader writes gl_FragDepth, then the fixed function value for depth will be
used as the fragmentâs depth value. If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragDepth, and there is an
execution path through the shader that does not set gl_FragDepth, then the value of the fragmentâs depth
may be undefined for executions of the shader that take that path. That is, if the set of linked fragment
shaders statically contain a write to gl_FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.
If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and the values of any user-defined
fragment outputs, gl_FragDepth, and gl_SampleMask become irrelevant.
The variable gl_FragCoord is available as an input variable from within fragment shaders and it holds the
window relative coordinates (x, y, z, 1/w) values for the fragment. If multi-sampling, this value can be for
any location within the pixel, or one of the fragment samples. The use of centroid does not further
restrict this value to be inside the current primitive. This value is the result of the fixed functionality that
interpolates primitives after vertex processing to generate fragments. The z component is the depth value
that would be used for the fragmentâs depth if no shader contained any writes to gl_FragDepth. This is




                                                126
                                                                                     7 Built-in Variables



useful for invariance if a shader conditionally computes gl_FragDepth but otherwise wants the fixed
functionality fragment depth.
Fragment shaders have access to the input built-in variable gl_FrontFacing, whose value is true if the
fragment belongs to a front-facing primitive. One use of this is to emulate two-sided lighting by selecting
one of two colors calculated by a vertex or geometry shader.
The values in gl_PointCoord are two-dimensional coordinates indicating where within a point primitive
the current fragment is located, when point sprites are enabled. They range from 0.0 to 1.0 across the
point. If the current primitive is not a point, or if point sprites are not enabled, then the values read from
gl_PointCoord are undefined.
For both the input array gl_SampleMaskIn[] and the output array gl_SampleMask[], bit B of mask M
(gl_SampleMaskIn[M] or gl_SampleMask[M]) corresponds to sample 32*M+B. These arrays have
ceil(s/32) elements, where s is the maximum number of color samples supported by the implementation.
The input variable gl_SampleMaskIn indicates the set of samples covered by the primitive generating the
fragment during multisample rasterization. It has a sample bit set if and only if the sample is considered
covered for this fragment shader invocation.
The output array gl_SampleMask[] sets the sample mask for the fragment being processed. Coverage for
the current fragment will become the logical AND of the coverage mask and the output gl_SampleMask.
This array must be sized in the fragment shader either implicitly or explicitly, to be no larger than the
implementation-dependent maximum sample-mask (as an array of 32bit elements), determined by the
maximum number of samples.. If the fragment shader statically assigns a value to gl_SampleMask, the
sample mask will be undefined for any array elements of any fragment shader invocations that fail to
assign a value. If a shader does not statically assign a value to gl_SampleMask, the sample mask has no
effect on the processing of a fragment.
The input variable gl_SampleID is filled with the sample number of the sample currently being processed.
This variable is in the range 0 to gl_NumSamples-1, where gl_NumSamples is the total number of samples
in the framebuffer, or 1 if rendering to a non-multisample framebuffer. Any static use of this variable in a
fragment shader causes the entire shader to be evaluated per-sample.
The input variable gl_SamplePosition contains the position of the current sample within the multi-sample
draw buffer. The x and y components of gl_SamplePosition contain the sub-pixel coordinate of the current
sample and will have values in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Any static use of this variable in a fragment shader
causes the entire shader to be evaluated per sample.
The gl_PerVertex block can be redeclared in a shader to explicitly indicate what subset of the fixed
pipeline interface will be used. This is necessary to establish the interface between multiple programs.
For example:
   out gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;   // will use gl_Position
       float gl_PointSize; // will use gl_PointSize
       vec4 t;             // error, only gl_PerVertex members allowed
   }; // no other members of gl_PerVertex will be used

This establishes the output interface the shader will use with the subsequent pipeline stage. It must be a
subset of the built-in members of gl_PerVertex. Such a redeclaration can also add the invariant qualifier,




                                                127
                                                                                            7 Built-in Variables



        interpolation qualifiers, and the layout qualifiers xfb_offset, xfb_buffer, and xfb_stride. It can also add
        an array size for unsized arrays. For example:
           out layout(xfb_buffer = 1, xfb_stride = 16) gl_PerVertex {
               vec4 gl_Position;
               layout(xfb_offset = 0) float gl_ClipDistance[4];
           };

        Other layout qualifiers, like location, cannot be added to such a redeclaration, unless specifically stated.
        If a built-in interface block is redeclared, it must appear in the shader before any use of any member
        included in the built-in declaration, or a compile-time error will result. It is also a compile-time error to
        redeclare the block more than once or to redeclare a built-in block and then use a member from that built-
        in block that was not included in the redeclaration. Also, if a built-in interface block is redeclared, no
        member of the built-in declaration can be redeclared outside the block redeclaration. If multiple shaders
        using members of a built-in block belonging to the same interface are linked together in the same
        program, they must all redeclare the built-in block in the same way, as described in section 4.3.9
        âInterface Blocksâ for interface block matching, or a link-time error will result. It will also be a link-time
        error if some shaders in a program redeclare a specific built-in interface block while another shader in that
        program does not redeclare that interface block yet still uses a member of that interface block. If a built-
        in block interface is formed across shaders in different programs, the shaders must all redeclare the built-
        in block in the same way (as described for a single program), or the values passed along the interface are
        undefined.

7.1.1   Compatibility Profile Built-In Language Variables
        When using the compatibility profile, the GL can provide fixed functionality behavior for the vertex and
        fragment programmable pipeline stages. For example, mixing a fixed functionality vertex stage with a
        programmable fragment stage.
        The following built-in vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, and geometry output variables
        are available to specify inputs for the subsequent programmable shader stage or the fixed functionality
        fragment stage. A particular one should be written to if any functionality in a corresponding fragment
        shader or fixed pipeline uses it or state derived from it. Otherwise, behavior is undefined. The following
        members are added to the output gl_PerVertex block in these languages:
           out gl_PerVertex {       // part of the gl_PerVertex block described in 7.1
               // in addition to other gl_PerVertex members...
               vec4 gl_ClipVertex;
               vec4 gl_FrontColor;
               vec4 gl_BackColor;
               vec4 gl_FrontSecondaryColor;
               vec4 gl_BackSecondaryColor;
               vec4 gl_TexCoord[];
               float gl_FogFragCoord;
           };

        The output variable gl_ClipVertex provides a place for vertex and geometry shaders to write the
        coordinate to be used with the user clipping planes. Writing to gl_ClipDistance is the preferred method
        for user clipping. It is a compile-time or link-time error for the set of shaders forming a program to




                                                       128
                                                                                   7 Built-in Variables



statically read or write both gl_ClipVertex and gl_ClipDistance. If neither gl_ClipVertex nor
gl_ClipDistance is written, their values are undefined and any clipping against user clip planes is also
undefined.
Similarly to what was previously described for the core profile, the gl_PerVertex block can be redeclared
in a shader to explicitly include these additional members. For example:
   out gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;    // will use gl_Position
       vec4 gl_FrontColor; // will consume gl_color in the fragment shader
       vec4 gl_BackColor;
       vec4 gl_TexCoord[3]; // 3 elements of gl_TexCoord will be used
   }; // no other aspects of the fixed interface will be used

The user must ensure the clip vertex and user clipping planes are defined in the same coordinate space.
User clip planes work properly only under linear transform. It is undefined what happens under non-
linear transform.
The output variables gl_FrontColor, glFrontSecondaryColor, gl_BackColor, and glBackSecondaryColor
assign primary and secondary colors for front and back faces of primitives containing the vertex being
processed. The output variable gl_TexCoord assigns texture coordinates for the vertex being processed.
For gl_FogFragCoord, the value written will be used as the âcâ value in section 16.4 âFogâ of the
compatibility profile of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, by the fixed functionality pipeline.
For example, if the z-coordinate of the fragment in eye space is desired as âcâ, then that's what the vertex
shader executable should write into gl_FogFragCoord.
As with all arrays, indices used to subscript gl_TexCoord must either be an integral constant expressions,
or this array must be redeclared by the shader with a size. The size can be at most gl_MaxTextureCoords.
Using indexes close to 0 may aid the implementation in preserving varying resources. The redeclaration
of gl_TexCoord can also be done at global scope as, for example:
   in vec4 gl_TexCoord[3];
   out vec4 gl_TexCoord[4];

(This treatment is a special case for gl_TexCoord[], not a general method for redeclaring members of
blocks.) It is a compile-time error to redeclare gl_TexCoord[] at global scope if there is a redeclaration
of the corresponding built-in block; only one form of redeclaration is allowed within a shader (and hence
within a stage, as block redeclarations must match across all shaders using it).
In the tessellation control, evaluation, and geometry shaders, the outputs of the previous stage described
above are also available in the input gl_PerVertex block in these languages.




                                               129
                                                                                    7 Built-in Variables



   in gl_PerVertex {        // part of the gl_PerVertex block described in 7.1
       // in addition to other gl_PerVertex members...
       vec4 gl_ClipVertex;
       vec4 gl_FrontColor;
       vec4 gl_BackColor;
       vec4 gl_FrontSecondaryColor;
       vec4 gl_BackSecondaryColor;
       vec4 gl_TexCoord[];
       float gl_FogFragCoord;
   } gl_in[];


These can be redeclared to establish an explicit pipeline interface, the same way as described above for
the output block gl_PerVertex, and the input redeclaration must match the output redeclaration of the
previous stage. However, when a built-in interface block with an instance name is redeclared (e.g., gl_in),
the instance name must be included in the redeclaration. It is a compile-time error to not include the built-
in instance name or to change its name. For example,
   in gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_ClipVertex;
       vec4 gl_FrontColor;
   } gl_in[]; // must be present and must be âgl_in[]â

Treatment of gl_TexCoord[] redeclaration is also identical to that described for the output block
gl_TexCoord[] redeclaration.
The following fragment input block is also available in a fragment shader when using the compatibility
profile:
   in gl_PerFragment {
       in float gl_FogFragCoord;
       in vec4 gl_TexCoord[];
       in vec4 gl_Color;
       in vec4 gl_SecondaryColor;
   };

The values in gl_Color and gl_SecondaryColor will be derived automatically by the system from
gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor, gl_FrontSecondaryColor, and gl_BackSecondaryColor based on which
face is visible in the primitive producing the fragment. If fixed functionality is used for vertex processing,
then gl_FogFragCoord will either be the z-coordinate of the fragment in eye space, or the interpolation of
the fog coordinate, as described in section 16.4 âFogâ of the compatibility profile of the OpenGL
Graphics System Specification. The gl_TexCoord[] values are the interpolated gl_TexCoord[] values
from a vertex shader or the texture coordinates of any fixed pipeline based vertex functionality.
Indices to the fragment shader gl_TexCoord array are as described above in the vertex shader text.
As described above for the input and output gl_PerVertex blocks, the gl_PerFragment block can be
redeclared to create an explicit interface to another program. When matching these interfaces between
separate programs, members in the gl_PerVertex output block must be declared if and only if the
corresponding fragment-shader members generated from them are present in the gl_PerFragment input
block. These matches are described in detail in section 7.4.1 âShader Interface Matchingâ of the OpenGL




                                               130
                                                                                         7 Built-in Variables



      Graphics System Specification. If they don't match within a program, a link-time error will result. If the
      mismatch is between two programs, values passed between programs are undefined. Unlike with all other
      block matching, the order of declaration within gl_PerFragment does not have to match across shaders
      and does not have to correspond with order of declaration in a matching gl_PerVertex redeclaration.
      The following fragment output variables are available in a fragment shader when using the compatibility
      profile:
         out vec4 gl_FragColor;
         out vec4 gl_FragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers];

      Writing to gl_FragColor specifies the fragment color that will be used by the subsequent fixed
      functionality pipeline. If subsequent fixed functionality consumes fragment color and an execution of the
      fragment shader executable does not write a value to gl_FragColor then the fragment color consumed is
      undefined.
      The variable gl_FragData is an array. Writing to gl_FragData[n] specifies the fragment data that will be
      used by the subsequent fixed functionality pipeline for data n. If subsequent fixed functionality consumes
      fragment data and an execution of a fragment shader executable does not write a value to it, then the
      fragment data consumed is undefined.
      If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragColor, it may not assign a value to any element of
      gl_FragData. If a shader statically writes a value to any element of gl_FragData, it may not assign a
      value to gl_FragColor. That is, a shader may assign values to either gl_FragColor or gl_FragData, but
      not both. Multiple shaders linked together must also consistently write just one of these variables.
      Similarly, if user-declared output variables are in use (statically assigned to), then the built-in variables
      gl_FragColor and gl_FragData may not be assigned to. These incorrect usages all generate compile-time
      or link-time errors.
      If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and the values of gl_FragDepth and
      gl_FragColor become irrelevant.

7.2   Compatibility Profile Vertex Shader Built-In Inputs
      The following predeclared input names can be used from within a vertex shader to access the current
      values of OpenGL state when using the compatibility profile.
         in   vec4    gl_Color;
         in   vec4    gl_SecondaryColor;

      dependent, but must be at least the value shown.

8 Built-in Functions

   The OpenGL Shading Language defines an assortment of built-in convenience functions for scalar and
   vector operations. Many of these built-in functions can be used in more than one type of shader, but some
   are intended to provide a direct mapping to hardware and so are available only for a specific type of
   shader.
   The built-in functions basically fall into three categories:
   â¢   They expose some necessary hardware functionality in a convenient way such as accessing a texture
       map. There is no way in the language for these functions to be emulated by a shader.
   â¢   They represent a trivial operation (clamp, mix, etc.) that is very simple for the user to write, but they
       are very common and may have direct hardware support. It is a very hard problem for the compiler to
       map expressions to complex assembler instructions.
   â¢   They represent an operation graphics hardware is likely to accelerate at some point. The trigonometry
       functions fall into this category.
   Many of the functions are similar to the same named ones in common C libraries, but they support vector
   input as well as the more traditional scalar input.
   Applications should be encouraged to use the built-in functions rather than do the equivalent computations
   in their own shader code since the built-in functions are assumed to be optimal (e.g., perhaps supported
   directly in hardware).
   User code can replace built-in functions with their own if they choose, by simply redeclaring and defining
   the same name and argument list. Because built-in functions are in a more outer scope than user built-in
   functions, doing this will hide all built-in functions with the same name as the redeclared function.
   When the built-in functions are specified below, where the input arguments (and corresponding output)
   can be float, vec2, vec3, or vec4, genType is used as the argument. Where the input arguments (and
   corresponding output) can be int, ivec2, ivec3, or ivec4, genIType is used as the argument. Where the
   input arguments (and corresponding output) can be uint, uvec2, uvec3, or uvec4, genUType is used as the
   argument. Where the input arguments (or corresponding output) can be bool, bvec2, bvec3, or bvec4,
   genBType is used as the argument. Where the input arguments (and corresponding output) can be double,
   dvec2, dvec3, dvec4, genDType is used as the argument. For any specific use of a function, the actual
   types substituted for genType, genIType, genUType, or genBType have to have the same number of
   components for all arguments and for the return type. Similarly, mat is used for any matrix basic type
   with single-precision components and dmat is used for any matrix basic type with double-precision
   components.

8.1   Angle and Trigonometry Functions
      Function parameters specified as angle are assumed to be in units of radians. In no case will any of these
      functions result in a divide by zero error. If the divisor of a ratio is 0, then results will be undefined.
      These all operate component-wise. The description is per component.

Syntax                                       Description
genType intBitsToFloat (genIType value)  Returns a float value corresponding to a signed or

       uint packSnorm2x16 (vec2 v)                    floating-point value v into 8- or 16-bit integer values.
       uint packUnorm4x8 (vec4 v)                     Then, the results are packed into the returned 32-bit
       uint packSnorm4x8 (vec4 v)                     unsigned integer.
                                                      The conversion for component c of v to fixed point is
                                                      done as follows:
                                                         packUnorm2x16: round(clamp(c, 0, +1) * 65535.0)
                                                         packSnorm2x16: round(clamp(c, -1, +1) * 32767.0)
                                                         packUnorm4x8: round(clamp(c, 0, +1) * 255.0)
                                                         packSnorm4x8: round(clamp(c, -1, +1) * 127.0)

                                                      The first component of the vector will be written to the
                                                      least significant bits of the output; the last component
                                                      will be written to the most significant bits.


       vec2 unpackUnorm2x16 (uint p)                  First, unpacks a single 32-bit unsigned integer p into a
       vec2 unpackSnorm2x16 (uint p)                  pair of 16-bit unsigned integers, a pair of 16-bit signed
       vec4 unpackUnorm4x8 (uint p)                   integers, four 8-bit unsigned integers, or four 8-bit
       vec4 unpackSnorm4x8 (uint p)                   signed integers. Then, each component is converted to a
                                                      normalized floating-point value to generate the returned
                                                      two- or four-component vector.

                                                      The conversion for unpacked fixed-point value f to
                                                      floating point is done as follows:

                                                         unpackUnorm2x16:        f / 65535.0
                                                         unpackSnorm2x16:       clamp(f / 32767.0, -1, +1)
                                                         unpackUnorm4x8:         f / 255.0
                                                         unpackSnorm4x8:         clamp(f / 127.0, -1, +1)

                                                      The first component of the returned vector will be
                                                      extracted from the least significant bits of the input; the
                                                      last component will be extracted from the most
                                                      significant bits.

Syntax                                Description
double packDouble2x32 (uvec2 v)      Returns a double-precision value obtained by packing
                                     the components of v into a 64-bit value. If an IEEE 754
                                     Inf or NaN is created, it will not signal, and the resulting
                                     floating-point value is unspecified. Otherwise, the bit-
                                     level representation of v is preserved. The first vector
                                     component specifies the 32 least significant bits; the
                                     second component specifies the 32 most significant bits.

                                     representation of v. The bit-level representation of v is
                                     preserved. The first component of the vector contains
                                     the 32 least significant bits of the double; the second
                                     component consists of the 32 most significant bits.


uint packHalf2x16 (vec2 v)           Returns an unsigned integer obtained by converting the
                                     components of a two-component floating-point vector to
                                     the 16-bit floating-point representation found in the
                                     OpenGL Specification, and then packing these two 16-
                                     bit integers into a 32-bit unsigned integer.
                                     The first vector component specifies the 16 least-
                                     significant bits of the result; the second component
                                     specifies the 16 most-significant bits.


vec2 unpackHalf2x16 (uint v)         Returns a two-component floating-point vector with
                                     components obtained by unpacking a 32-bit unsigned
                                     integer into a pair of 16-bit values, interpreting those
                                     values as 16-bit floating-point numbers according to the
                                     OpenGL Specification, and converting them to 32-bit
                                     floating-point values.
                                     The first component of the vector is obtained from the
                                     16 least-significant bits of v; the second component is
                                     obtained from the 16 most-significant bits of v.

8.9   Texture Functions
      Texture lookup functions are available in all shading stages. However, automatic level of detail is
      computed only for fragment shaders. Other shaders operate as though the base level of detail were
      computed as zero. The functions in the table below provide access to textures through samplers, as set up
      through the OpenGL API. Texture properties such as size, pixel format, number of dimensions, filtering
      method, number of mipmap levels, depth comparison, and so on are also defined by OpenGL API calls.
      Such properties are taken into account as the texture is accessed via the built-in functions defined below.
      Texture data can be stored by the GL as single-precision floating point, unsigned normalized integer,
      unsigned integer or signed integer data. This is determined by the type of the internal format of the
      texture. Texture lookups on unsigned normalized integer and floating-point data return floating-point
      values in the range [0, 1].
      Texture lookup functions are provided that can return their result as floating point, unsigned integer or
      signed integer, depending on the sampler type passed to the lookup function. Care must be taken to use
      the right sampler type for texture access. The following table lists the supported combinations of sampler
      types and texture internal formats. Blank entries are unsupported. Doing a texture lookup will return
      undefined values for unsupported combinations.

            Floating point                  Supported
            Normalized Integer              Supported
            Signed Integer                                       Supported
            Unsigned Integer                                                         Supported


      If an integer sampler type is used, the result of a texture lookup is an ivec4. If an unsigned integer sampler
      type is used, the result of a texture lookup is a uvec4. If a floating-point sampler type is used, the result of
      a texture lookup is a vec4, where each component is in the range [0, 1].
      In the prototypes below, the âgâ in the return type âgvec4â is used as a placeholder for nothing, âiâ, or âuâ
      making a return type of vec4, ivec4, or uvec4. In these cases, the sampler argument type also starts with
      âgâ, indicating the same substitution done on the return type; it is either a single-precision floating point,
      signed integer, or unsigned integer sampler, matching the basic type of the return type, as described
      above.
      For shadow forms (the sampler parameter is a shadow-type), a depth comparison lookup on the depth
      texture bound to sampler is done as described in section 8.22 âTexture Comparison Modesâ of the
      OpenGL Graphics System Specification. See the table below for which component specifies Dref. The
      texture bound to sampler must be a depth texture, or results are undefined. If a non-shadow texture call is
      made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth comparisons turned on, then results are
      undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth
      comparisons turned off, then results are undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that does
      not represent a depth texture, then results are undefined.




                                                      157
                                                                                           8 Built-in Functions



        In all functions below, the bias parameter is optional for fragment shaders. The bias parameter is not
        accepted in any other shader stage. For a fragment shader, if bias is present, it is added to the implicit
        level of detail prior to performing the texture access operation. No bias or lod parameters for rectangle
        textures, multi-sample textures, or texture buffers are supported because mipmaps are not allowed for
        these types of textures.
        The implicit level of detail is selected as follows: For a texture that is not mipmapped, the texture is used
        directly. If it is mipmapped and running in a fragment shader, the LOD computed by the implementation
        is used to do the texture lookup. If it is mipmapped and running on the vertex shader, then the base
        texture is used.
        Some texture functions (non-âLodâ and non-âGradâ versions) may require implicit derivatives. Implicit
        derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow and for non-fragment-shader texture fetches.
        For Cube forms, the direction of P is used to select which face to do a 2-dimensional texture lookup in, as
        described in section 8.13 âCube Map Texture Selectionâ in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification.
        For Array forms, the array layer used will be
          max (0,min(d â1, floor(layer+0.5)))
        where d is the depth of the texture array and layer comes from the component indicated in the tables
        below.
        For depth/stencil textures, the sampler type should match the component being accessed as set through the
        OpenGL API. When the depth/stencil texture mode is set to DEPTH_COMPONENT, a floating-point
        sampler type should be used. When the depth/stencil texture mode is set to STENCIL_INDEX, an
        unsigned integer sampler type should be used. Doing a texture lookup with an unsupported combination
        will return undefined values.

8.9.1   Texture Query Functions
        The textureSize functions query the dimensions of a specific texture level for a sampler.
        The textureQueryLod functions are available only in a fragment shader. They take the components of P
        and compute the level of detail information that the texture pipe would use to access that texture through a
        normal texture lookup. The level of detail Î»' (equation 3.18 in the OpenGL Graphics System
        Specification) is obtained after any LOD bias, but prior to clamping to [TEXTURE_MIN_LOD,
        TEXTURE_MAX_LOD]. The mipmap array(s) that would be accessed are also computed. If a single
        level of detail would be accessed, the level-of-detail number relative to the base level is returned. If
        multiple levels of detail would be accessed, a floating-point number between the two levels is returned,
        with the fractional part equal to the fractional part of the computed and clamped level of detail.

The algorithm used is given by the following pseudo-code:
   float ComputeAccessedLod(float computedLod)
   {
       // Clamp the computed LOD according to the texture LOD clamps.
       if (computedLod < TEXTURE_MIN_LOD) computedLod = TEXTURE_MIN_LOD;
       if (computedLod > TEXTURE_MAX_LOD) computedLod = TEXTURE_MAX_LOD;

        // Clamp the computed LOD to the range of accessible levels.
        if (computedLod < 0.0)
            computedLod = 0.0;
        if (computedLod > (float)
            maxAccessibleLevel) computedLod = (float) maxAccessibleLevel;

        // Return a value according to the min filter.
        if (TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is LINEAR or NEAREST) {
            return 0.0;
        } else if (TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST
                   or LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST) {
            return ceil(computedLod + 0.5) - 1.0;
        } else {
            return computedLod;
        }
   }

The value maxAccessibleLevel is the level number of the smallest accessible level of the mipmap array
(the value q in section 8.14.3 âMipmappingâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification) minus the
base level.

8.9.3   Texture Gather Functions
        The texture gather functions take components of a single floating-point vector operand as a texture
        coordinate, determine a set of four texels to sample from the base level of detail of the specified texture
        image, and return one component from each texel in a four-component result vector.
        When performing a texture gather operation, the minification and magnification filters are ignored, and
        the rules for LINEAR filtering in the OpenGL Specification are applied to the base level of the texture
        image to identify the four texels i0j1, i1j1, i1j0, and i0j0. The texels are then converted to texture base colors
        (Rs, Gs, Bs, As) according to table 15.1, followed by application of the texture swizzle as described in
        section 15.2.1 âTexture Accessâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification. A four-component
        vector is assembled by taking the selected component from each of the post-swizzled texture source colors
        in the order (i0j1, i1j1, i1j0, i0j0).
        For texture gather functions using a shadow sampler type, each of the four texel lookups perform a depth
        comparison against the depth reference value passed in (refZ), and returns the result of that comparison in
        the appropriate component of the result vector.
        As with other texture lookup functions, the results of a texture gather are undefined for shadow samplers if
        the texture referenced is not a depth texture or has depth comparisons disabled; or for non-shadow
        samplers if the texture referenced is a depth texture with depth comparisons enabled.

8.10   Atomic-Counter Functions
       The atomic-counter operations in this section operate atomically with respect to each other. They are
       atomic for any single counter, meaning any of these operations on a specific counter in one shader
       instantiation will be indivisible by any of these operations on the same counter from another shader
       instantiation. There is no guarantee that these operations are atomic with respect to other forms of access
       to the counter or that they are serialized when applied to separate counters. Such cases would require
       additional use of fences, barriers, or other forms of synchronization, if atomicity or serialization is desired.
       The value returned by an atomic-counter function is the value of an atomic counter, which may be
           â¢    returned and incremented in an atomic operation, or
           â¢    decremented and returned in an atomic operation, or
           â¢    simply returned.
       The underlying counter is a 32-bit unsigned integer. Increments and decrements at the limit of the range
       will wrap to [0, 232-1].

8.11   Atomic Memory Functions
       Atomic memory functions perform atomic operations on an individual signed or unsigned integer stored in
       buffer-object or shared-variable storage. All of the atomic memory operations read a value from memory,
       compute a new value using one of the operations described below, write the new value to memory, and
       return the original value read. The contents of the memory being updated by the atomic operation are
       guaranteed not to be modified by any other assignment or atomic memory function in any shader
       invocation between the time the original value is read and the time the new value is written.

       Atomic memory functions are supported only for a limited set of variables. A shader will fail to compile
       if the value passed to the mem argument of an atomic memory function does not correspond to a buffer or
       shared variable. It is acceptable to pass an element of an array or a single component of a vector to the
       mem argument of an atomic memory function, as long as the underlying array or vector is a buffer or
       shared variable.


        Syntax                                              Description
        uint atomicAdd (inout uint mem, uint data)          Computes a new value by adding the value of data to
        int atomicAdd (inout int mem, int data)             the contents mem.

        uint atomicMin (inout uint mem, uint data)          Computes a new value by taking the minimum of the
        int atomicMin (inout int mem, int data)             value of data and the contents of mem.

        uint atomicMax (inout uint mem, uint data)          Computes a new value by taking the maximum of the
        int atomicMax (inout int mem, int data)             value of data and the contents of mem.

        uint atomicAnd (inout uint mem, uint data)          Computes a new value by performing a bit-wise
        int atomicAnd (inout int mem, int data)             AND of the value of data and the contents of mem.

        uint atomicOr (inout uint mem, uint data)           Computes a new value by performing a bit-wise OR
        int atomicOr (inout int mem, int data)              of the value of data and the contents of mem.

        uint atomicXor (inout uint mem, uint data)          Computes a new value by performing a bit-wise
        int atomicXor (inout int mem, int data)             EXCLUSIVE OR of the value of data and the
                                                            contents of mem.
        uint atomicExchange (inout uint mem, uint data) Computes a new value by simply copying the value
        int atomicExchange (inout int mem, int data)    of data.

        uint atomicCompSwap (inout uint mem,                Compares the value of compare and the contents of
                             uint compare, uint data)       mem. If the values are equal, the new value is given
        int atomicCompSwap (inout int mem,                  by data; otherwise, it is taken from the original
                              int compare, int data)        contents of mem.



8.12   Image Functions
       Variables using one of the image basic types may be used by the built-in shader image memory functions
       defined in this section to read and write individual texels of a texture. Each image variable references an
       image unit, which has a texture image attached.
       When image memory functions below access memory, an individual texel in the image is identified using
       an (i), (i, j), or (i, j, k) coordinate corresponding to the values of P. For image2DMS and
       image2DMSArray variables (and the corresponding int/unsigned int types) corresponding to multi-
       sample textures, each texel may have multiple samples and an individual sample is identified using the

integer sample parameter. The coordinates and sample number are used to select an individual texel in
the manner described in section 8.25 âTexture Image Loads and Storesâ of the OpenGL specification.
Loads and stores support float, integer, and unsigned integer types. The data types below starting
âgimageâ serve as placeholders meaning types starting either âimageâ, âiimageâ, or âuimageâ in the same
way as gvec or gsampler in earlier sections.
The IMAGE_PARAMS in the prototypes below is a placeholder representing 33 separate functions, each
for a different type of image variable. The IMAGE_PARAMS placeholder is replaced by one of the
following parameter lists:
        gimage1D image, int P
        gimage2D image, ivec2 P
        gimage3D image, ivec3 P
        gimage2DRect image, ivec2 P
        gimageCube image, ivec3 P
        gimageBuffer image, int P
        gimage1DArray image, ivec2 P
        gimage2DArray image, ivec3 P
        gimageCubeArray image, ivec3 P
        gimage2DMS image, ivec2 P, int sample
        gimage2DMSArray image, ivec3 P, int sample
where each of the lines represents one of three different image variable types, and image, P, and sample
specify the individual texel to operate on. The method for identifying the individual texel operated on
from image, P, and sample, and the method for reading and writing the texel are specified in section 8.25
âTexture Image Loads and Storesâ of the OpenGL specification.
The atomic functions perform atomic operations on individual texels or samples of an image variable.
Atomic memory operations read a value from the selected texel, compute a new value using one of the
operations described below, write the new value to the selected texel, and return the original value read.
The contents of the texel being updated by the atomic operation are guaranteed not to be modified by any
other image store or atomic function between the time the original value is read and the time the new
value is written.
Atomic memory operations are supported on only a subset of all image variable types; image must be
either:
    â¢    a signed integer image variable (type starts âiimageâ) and a format qualifier of r32i, used with a
         data argument of type int, or
    â¢    an unsigned image variable (type starts âuimageâ) and a format qualifier of r32ui, used with a
         data argument of type uint.

8.13   Fragment Processing Functions
       Fragment processing functions are only available in fragment shaders.

8.13.1 Derivative Functions
       Derivatives may be computationally expensive and/or numerically unstable. Therefore, an OpenGL
       implementation may approximate the true derivatives by using a fast but not entirely accurate derivative
       computation. Derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow.
       The expected behavior of a derivative is specified using forward/backward differencing.
       Forward differencing:
            F ( x+dx)â F ( x) â¼ dFdx ( x)âdx         1a
                        F ( x+dx)â F ( x)
           dFdx (x) â¼                                1b
                               dx


       Backward differencing:


           F ( xâdx)â F ( x) â¼ âdFdx( x)âdx          2a
                        F ( x)âF ( xâdx)
           dFdx (x) â¼                                2b
                               dx


       With single-sample rasterization, dx <= 1.0 in equations 1b and 2b. For multi-sample rasterization, dx <
       2.0 in equations 1b and 2b.
       dFdy is approximated similarly, with y replacing x.
       A GL implementation may use the above or other methods to perform the calculation, subject to the
       following conditions:
       1. The method may use piecewise linear approximations. Such linear approximations imply that higher
          order derivatives, dFdx(dFdx(x)) and above, are undefined.
       2. The method may assume that the function evaluated is continuous. Therefore derivatives within non-
          uniform control flow are undefined.
       3. The method may differ per fragment, subject to the constraint that the method may vary by window
          coordinates, not screen coordinates. The invariance requirement described in section 14.2
          âInvarianceâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, is relaxed for derivative calculations,
          because the method may be a function of fragment location.
       Other properties that are desirable, but not required, are:
       4. Functions should be evaluated within the interior of a primitive (interpolated, not extrapolated).




                                                      177
                                                                                           8 Built-in Functions



       5. Functions for dFdx should be evaluated while holding y constant. Functions for dFdy should be
          evaluated while holding x constant. However, mixed higher order derivatives, like dFdx(dFdy(y))
          and dFdy(dFdx(x)) are undefined.
       6. Derivatives of constant arguments should be 0.
       In some implementations, varying degrees of derivative accuracy may be obtained by providing GL hints
       (section 21.4 âHintsâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification), allowing a user to make an image
       quality versus speed trade off.


        Syntax                                           Description
        genType dFdx (genType p)                         Returns the derivative in x using local differencing for
                                                         the input argument p.


        genType dFdy (genType p)                         Returns the derivative in y using local differencing for
                                                         the input argument p.

                                                         These two functions are commonly used to estimate the
                                                         filter width used to anti-alias procedural textures. We
                                                         are assuming that the expression is being evaluated in
                                                         parallel on a SIMD array so that at any given point in
                                                         time the value of the function is known at the grid points
                                                         represented by the SIMD array. Local differencing
                                                         between SIMD array elements can therefore be used to
                                                         derive dFdx, dFdy, etc.

        genType fwidth (genType p)                       Returns the sum of the absolute derivative in x and y
                                                         using local differencing for the input argument p, i.e.,
                                                         abs (dFdx (p)) + abs (dFdy (p));



8.13.2 Interpolation Functions
       Built-in interpolation functions are available to compute an interpolated value of a fragment shader input
       variable at a shader-specified (x, y) location. A separate (x, y) location may be used for each invocation of
       the built-in function, and those locations may differ from the default (x, y) location used to produce the
       default value of the input.
       For all of the interpolation functions, interpolant must be an input variable or an element of an input
       variable declared as an array. Component selection operators (e.g., .xy) may be used when specifying
       interpolant. Arrayed inputs can be indexed with general (nonuniform) integer expressions. If interpolant
       is declared with the flat qualifier, the interpolated value will have the same value everywhere for a single
       primitive, so the location used for interpolation has no effect and the functions just return that same value.
       If interpolant is declared with the centroid qualifier, the value returned by interpolateAtSample() and
       interpolateAtOffset() will be evaluated at the specified location, ignoring the location normally used
       with the centroid qualifier. If interpolant is declared with the noperspective qualifier, the interpolated
       value will be computed without perspective correction.

        float interpolateAtCentroid (float interpolant)    Returns the value of the input interpolant sampled at
        vec2 interpolateAtCentroid (vec2 interpolant)      a location inside both the pixel and the primitive
        vec3 interpolateAtCentroid (vec3 interpolant)      being processed. The value obtained would be the
        vec4 interpolateAtCentroid (vec4 interpolant)      same value assigned to the input variable if declared
                                                           with the centroid qualifier.


        float interpolateAtSample (float interpolant,      Returns the value of the input interpolant variable at
                                   int sample)             the location of sample number sample. If
        vec2 interpolateAtSample (vec2 interpolant,        multisample buffers are not available, the input
                                   int sample)             variable will be evaluated at the center of the pixel.
        vec3 interpolateAtSample (vec3 interpolant,        If sample sample does not exist, the position used to
                                   int sample)             interpolate the input variable is undefined.

                                   int sample)


        float interpolateAtOffset (float interpolant,      Returns the value of the input interpolant variable
                                   vec2 offset)            sampled at an offset from the center of the pixel
        vec2 interpolateAtOffset (vec2 interpolant,        specified by offset. The two floating-point
                                   vec2 offset)            components of offset, give the offset in pixels in the x
        vec3 interpolateAtOffset (vec3 interpolant,        and y directions, respectively. An offset of (0, 0)
                                   vec2 offset)            identifies the center of the pixel. The range and
        vec4 interpolateAtOffset (vec4 interpolant,        granularity of offsets supported by this function is
                                   vec2 offset)            implementation-dependent.




8.14   Noise Functions
       The noise functions noise1, noise2, noise3, and noise4 have been deprecated starting with version 4.4 of
       GLSL. They are defined to return the value 0.0 or a vector whose components are all 0.0. However, as in
       previous releases, they are not semantically considered to be compile-time constant expressions.


        Syntax (deprecated)                             Description (deprecated)
        float noise1 (genType x)                        Returns a 1D noise value based on the input value x.


        vec2 noise2 (genType x)                         Returns a 2D noise value based on the input value x.

8.15   Geometry Shader Functions
       These functions are only available in geometry shaders. They are described in more depth following the
       table.

        Syntax                                      Description
        void EmitStreamVertex (int stream)         Emits the current values of output variables to the current
                                                   output primitive on stream stream. The argument to stream
                                                   must be a constant integral expression. On return from this
                                                   call, the values of all output variables are undefined.
                                                   Can only be used if multiple output streams are supported.


        void EndStreamPrimitive (int stream)       Completes the current output primitive on stream stream and
                                                   starts a new one. The argument to stream must be a constant
                                                   integral expression. No vertex is emitted.
                                                   Can only be used if multiple output streams are supported.


        void EmitVertex ()                         Emits the current values of output variables to the current
                                                   output primitive. On return from this call, the values of
                                                   output variables are undefined.
                                                   When multiple output streams are supported, this is
                                                   equivalent to calling EmitStreamVertex(0).


        void EndPrimitive ()                       Completes the current output primitive and starts a new one.
                                                   No vertex is emitted.
                                                   When multiple output streams are supported, this is
                                                   equivalent to calling EndStreamPrimitive(0).



       The function EmitStreamVertex() specifies that a vertex is completed. A vertex is added to the current
       output primitive in vertex stream stream using the current values of all built-in and user-defined output
       variables associated with stream. The values of all output variables for all output streams are undefined
       after a call to EmitStreamVertex(). If a geometry shader invocation has emitted more vertices than
       permitted by the output layout qualifier max_vertices, the results of calling EmitStreamVertex() are
       undefined.
       The function EndStreamPrimitive() specifies that the current output primitive for vertex stream stream is
       completed and a new output primitive (of the same type) will be started by any subsequent
       EmitStreamVertex(). This function does not emit a vertex. If the output layout is declared to be
       âpointsâ, calling EndStreamPrimitive() is optional.
       A geometry shader starts with an output primitive containing no vertices for each stream. When a
       geometry shader terminates, the current output primitive for each stream is automatically completed. It is

Multiple output streams are supported only if the output primitive type is declared to be points. A
program will fail to link if it contains a geometry shader calling EmitStreamVertex() or
EndStreamPrimitive() if its output primitive type is not points.

8.16   Shader Invocation Control Functions
       The shader invocation control function is available only in tessellation control shaders and compute
       shaders. It is used to control the relative execution order of multiple shader invocations used to process a
       patch (in the case of tessellation control shaders) or a local work group (in the case of compute shaders),
       which are otherwise executed with an undefined relative order.

        Syntax                         Description
        void barrier ()                For any given static instance of barrier(), all tessellation control shader
                                       invocations for a single input patch must enter it before any will be
                                       allowed to continue beyond it, or all invocations for a single work group
                                       must enter it before any will continue beyond it.



       The function barrier() provides a partially defined order of execution between shader invocations. This
       ensures that values written by one invocation prior to a given static instance of barrier() can be safely
       read by other invocations after their call to the same static instance barrier(). Because invocations may
       execute in undefined order between these barrier calls, the values of a per-vertex or per-patch output
       variable or shared variables for compute shaders will be undefined in a number of cases enumerated in
       section 4.3.6 âOutput Variablesâ (for tessellation control shaders) and section 4.3.8 "Shared Variables"
       (for compute shaders).
       For tessellation control shaders, the barrier() function may only be placed inside the function main() of
       the tessellation control shader and may not be called within any control flow. Barriers are also disallowed
       after a return statement in the function main(). Any such misplaced barriers result in a compile-time
       error.
       For compute shaders, the barrier() function may be placed within flow control, but that flow control must
       be uniform flow control. That is, all the controlling expressions that lead to execution of the barrier must
       be dynamically uniform expressions. This ensures that if any shader invocation enters a conditional
       statement, then all invocations will enter it. While compilers are encouraged to give warnings if they can
       detect this might not happen, compilers cannot completely determine this. Hence, it is the author's
       responsibility to ensure barrier() only exists inside uniform flow control. Otherwise, some shader
       invocations will stall indefinitely, waiting for a barrier that is never reached by other invocations.




                                                     182
                                                                                         8 Built-in Functions



8.17   Shader Memory Control Functions
       Shaders of all types may read and write the contents of textures and buffer objects using image variables.
       While the order of reads and writes within a single shader invocation is well-defined, the relative order of
       reads and writes to a single shared memory address from multiple separate shader invocations is largely
       undefined. The order of memory accesses performed by one shader invocation, as observed by other
       shader invocations, is also largely undefined but can be controlled through memory control functions.


        Syntax                                      Description
        void memoryBarrier ()                       Control the ordering of memory transactions issued by a
                                                    single shader invocation.


        void memoryBarrierAtomicCounter () Control the ordering of accesses to atomic-counter variables
                                           issued by a single shader invocation.


        void memoryBarrierBuffer ()                 Control the ordering of memory transactions to buffer
                                                    variables issued within a single shader invocation.


        void memoryBarrierShared ()                 Control the ordering of memory transactions to shared
                                                    variables issued within a single shader invocation.
                                                    Only available in compute shaders.


        void memoryBarrierImage ()                  Control the ordering of memory transactions to images
                                                    issued within a single shader invocation.


        void groupMemoryBarrier ()                  Control the ordering of all memory transactions issued within
                                                    a single shader invocation, as viewed by other invocations in
                                                    the same work group.
                                                    Only available in compute shaders.



       The memory barrier built-in functions can be used to order reads and writes to variables stored in memory
       accessible to other shader invocations. When called, these functions will wait for the completion of all
       reads and writes previously performed by the caller that access selected variable types, and then return
       with no other effect. The built-in functions memoryBarrierAtomicCounter(), memoryBarrierBuffer(),
       memoryBarrierImage(), and memoryBarrierShared() wait for the completion of accesses to atomic
       counter, buffer, image, and shared variables, respectively. The built-in functions memoryBarrier() and
       groupMemoryBarrier() wait for the completion of accesses to all of the above variable types. The
       functions memoryBarrierShared() and groupMemoryBarrier() are available only in compute shaders;
       the other functions are available in all shader types.




                                                     183
                                                                                  8 Built-in Functions



When these functions return, the results of any memory stores performed using coherent variables
performed prior to the call will be visible to any future coherent access to the same memory performed by
any other shader invocation. In particular, the values written this way in one shader stage are guaranteed
to be visible to coherent memory accesses performed by shader invocations in subsequent stages when
those invocations were triggered by the execution of the original shader invocation (e.g., fragment shader
invocations for a primitive resulting from a particular geometry shader invocation).
Additionally, memory barrier functions order stores performed by the calling invocation, as observed by
other shader invocations. Without memory barriers, if one shader invocation performs two stores to
coherent variables, a second shader invocation might see the values written by the second store prior to
seeing those written by the first. However, if the first shader invocation calls a memory barrier function
between the two stores, selected other shader invocations will never see the results of the second store
before seeing those of the first. When using the function groupMemoryBarrier(), this ordering
guarantee applies only to other shader invocations in the same compute shader work group; all other
memory barrier functions provide the guarantee to all other shader invocations. No memory barrier is
required to guarantee the order of memory stores as observed by the invocation performing the stores; an
invocation reading from a variable that it previously wrote will always see the most recently written value
unless another shader invocation also wrote to the same memory.
