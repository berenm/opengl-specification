1 Introduction

   This document specifies only version 4.00 of the OpenGL Shading Language. It requires __VERSION__
   to substitute 400, and requires #version to accept only 400. If #version is declared with a smaller
   number, the language accepted is a previous version of the shading language, which will be supported
   depending on the version and type of context in the OpenGL API. See the OpenGL Graphics System
   Specification, Version 4.0, for details on what language versions are supported.
   All OpenGL Graphics System Specification references in this specification are to version 4.0.

1.2     Changes
1.2.1   Changes from Revision 8
        â¢   Corrected a reference to version 3.4 to be 4.0.
        â¢   Remove âfixedâ from the description of interpolateAtOffset, it was extraneous.
        â¢   Added samplerCubeShadow to the type table in section 4.1. It was already part of the specification,
            just missing from this table.

1.2.2   Summary of Changes from Version 3.30
        Note: No features were removed or deprecated between versions 3.30 and 4.00.
        The following features are added:
        â¢   Tessellation, which includes two new programmable stages, tessellation control stage and tessellation
            evaluation stage. Includes barrier() built-in for synchronization.
        â¢   Polymorphic functions: Run-time selection of what function gets called, through the new keyword
            subroutine.
        â¢   64bit floating point numbers with the new type keyword double. Built-in functions extended for
            doubles, and new function matching rules are added to both allow implicit conversions when calling a
            function and preserve most existing function matching once doubles are included.
        â¢   More implicit conversions
              float to double, and similarly for all floating-point vector and matrix types
              int to uint, and similarly for all integer vector types
              int to double, and similarly for all vectors of integers and doubles.
              unint to double, and similarly for all vectors of integers and doubles.
        â¢   Cube map array textures and texture functions texture(), textureSize(), textureLod(), and
            textureGrad().
        â¢   Sampler arrays can take a variable index now, as long as it's value is uniform for all uses.
        â¢   Per-sample shading. Including sample input mask gl_SampleMaskIn[] and per-sample
            interpolation, with explicit interpolation built-ins interpolateAtCentroid(), interpolateAtSample(),
            and interpolateAtOffset().
        â¢   New precise qualifier to disallow optimizations that re-order operations or treat different instances of
            the same operator with different precision.
        â¢   Add a fused multiply and add built-in, fma(), in relation to the new precise qualifier. (Because âa * b
            + câ will require two operations under new rules for precise.)
        â¢   Added new built-in floating-point functions
              frexp() and ldexp()
              packUnorm2x16(), packUnorm4x8(), packSnorm4x8(), and packDouble2x32()
              unpackUnorm2x16(), unpackUnorm4x8(), unpackSnorm4x8(), and unpackDouble2x32()
        â¢   Add new built-in integer functions
              uaddCarry() and usubBorrow()
              umulExtended() and imulExtended()
              bitfieldExtract() and bitfieldInsert()
              bitfieldReverse()
              bitCount(), findLSB(), and findMSB()
        â¢   New built-in to query LOD, textureQueryLod().
        â¢   New overloaded function matching algorithm, handling selection from many valid multiple choices.




                                                        3
                                                                                              1 Introduction



      â¢   Texture gather functions that return four texels with a single call.
             textureGather()
             textureGatherOffset()
             textureGatherOffsets()
      â¢   Geometry shading
      â¢   Add streams out from geometry shader. Output can be directed to streams through
          EmitStreamVertex() and EndStreamPrimitive().

1.3   Overview
      This document describes The OpenGL Shading Language, version 4.00.
      Independent compilation units written in this language are called shaders. A program is a complete set of
      shaders that are compiled and linked together. The aim of this document is to thoroughly specify the
      programming language. The OpenGL Graphics System Specification will specify the OpenGL entry
      points used to manipulate and communicate with programs and shaders.

1.4   Error Handling
      Compilers, in general, accept programs that are ill-formed, due to the impossibility of detecting all ill-
      formed programs. Portability is only ensured for well-formed programs, which this specification
      describes. Compilers are encouraged to detect ill-formed programs and issue diagnostic messages, but are
      not required to do so for all cases. Compilers are required to return messages regarding lexically,
      grammatically, or semantically incorrect shaders.

1.5   Typographical Conventions
      Italic, bold, and font choices have been used in this specification primarily to improve readability. Code
      fragments use a fixed width font. Identifiers embedded in text are italicized. Keywords embedded in text
      are bold. Operators are called by their name, followed by their symbol in bold in parentheses. The
      clarifying grammar fragments in the text use bold for literals and italics for non-terminals. The official
      grammar in section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ uses all capitals for terminals and lower case for
      non-terminals.

1.6   Deprecation
      Previous versions of the OpenGL Shading Language deprecated some features. These are clearly called
      out in this specification as âdeprecatedâ. They are still present in this version of the language, but are
      targeted for potential removal in a future version of the shading language. The OpenGL API has a
      forward compatibility mode that will disallow use of deprecated features. If compiling in a mode where
      use of deprecated features is disallowed, their use causes compile time errors. See the OpenGL Graphics
      System Specification for details on what causes deprecated language features to be accepted or to return
      an error.




                                                      4
2 Overview of OpenGL Shading

      The OpenGL Shading Language is actually several closely related languages. These languages are used
      to create shaders for each of the programmable processors contained in the OpenGL processing pipeline.
      Currently, these processors are the vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, and
      fragment processors.
      Unless otherwise noted in this paper, a language feature applies to all languages, and common usage will
      refer to these languages as a single language. The specific languages will be referred to by the name of
      the processor they target: vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, or fragment.
      Most OpenGL state is not tracked or made available to shaders. Typically, user-defined variables will be
      used for communicating between different stages of the OpenGL pipeline. However, a small amount of
      state is still tracked and automatically made available to shaders, and there are a few built-in variables for
      interfaces between different stages of the OpenGL pipeline.

2.1   Vertex Processor
      The vertex processor is a programmable unit that operates on incoming vertices and their associated data.
      Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called vertex
      shaders. When a complete set of vertex shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a vertex shader
      executable that runs on the vertex processor.
      The vertex processor operates on one vertex at a time. It does not replace graphics operations that require
      knowledge of several vertices at a time.

2.2   Tessellation Control Processor
      The tessellation control processor is a programmable unit that operates on a patch of incoming vertices
      and their associated data, emitting a new output patch. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading
      Language to run on this processor are called tessellation control shaders. When a complete set of
      tessellation control shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a tessellation control shader executable
      that runs on the tessellation control processor.

      The tessellation control shader is invoked for each vertex of the output patch. Each invocation can read
      the attributes of any vertex in the input or output patches, but can only write per-vertex attributes for the
      corresponding output patch vertex. The shader invocations collectively produce a set of per-patch
      attributes for the output patch. After all tessellation control shader invocations have completed, the output
      vertices and per-patch attributes are assembled to form a patch to be used by subsequent pipeline stages.




                                                      5
                                                                         2 Overview of OpenGL Shading



      Tessellation control shader invocation run mostly independently, with undefined relative execution order.
      However, the built-in function barrier() can be used to control execution order by synchronizing
      invocations, effectively dividing tessellation control shader execution into a set of phases. Tessellation
      control shaders will get undefined results if one invocation reads a per-vertex or per-patch attribute
      written by another invocation at any point during the same phase, or if two invocations attempt to write
      different values to the same per-patch output in a single phase.

2.3   Tessellation Evaluation Processor
      The tessellation evaluation processor is a programmable unit that evaluates the position and other
      attributes of a vertex generated by the tessellation primitive generator, using a patch of incoming vertices
      and their associated data. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this
      processor are called tessellation evaluation shaders. When a complete set of tessellation evaluation
      shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a tessellation evaluation shader executable that runs on the
      tessellation evaluation processor.
      Each invocation of the tessellation evaluation executable computes the position and attributes of a single
      vertex generated by the tessellation primitive generator. The executable can read the attributes of any
      vertex in the input patch, plus the tessellation coordinate, which is the relative location of the vertex in the
      primitive being tessellated. The executable writes the position and other attributes of the vertex.

2.4   Geometry Processor
      The geometry processor is a programmable unit that operates on data for incoming vertices for a primitive
      assembled after vertex processing and outputs a sequence of vertices forming output primitives.
      Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called geometry
      shaders. When a complete set of geometry shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a geometry
      shader executable that runs on the geometry processor.
      A single invocation of the geometry shader executable on the geometry processor will operate on a
      declared input primitive with a fixed number of vertices. This single invocation can emit a variable
      number of vertices that are assembled into primitives of a declared output primitive type and passed to
      subsequent pipeline stages.

2.5   Fragment Processor
      The fragment processor is a programmable unit that operates on fragment values and their associated
      data. Compilation units written in the OpenGL Shading Language to run on this processor are called
      fragment shaders. When a complete set of fragment shaders are compiled and linked, they result in a
      fragment shader executable that runs on the fragment processor.
      A fragment shader cannot change a fragment's (x, y) position. Access to neighboring fragments is not
      allowed. The values computed by the fragment shader are ultimately used to update framebuffer memory
      or texture memory, depending on the current OpenGL state and the OpenGL command that caused the
      fragments to be generated.

3 Basics

3.1   Character Set
      The source character set used for the OpenGL shading languages is a subset of ASCII. It includes the
      following characters:
            The letters a-z, A-Z, and the underscore ( _ ).
            The numbers 0-9.
            The symbols period (.), plus (+), dash (-), slash (/), asterisk (*), percent (%), angled brackets (< and
            >), square brackets ( [ and ] ), parentheses ( ( and ) ), braces ( { and } ), caret (^), vertical bar ( | ),
            ampersand (&), tilde (~), equals (=), exclamation point (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), comma (,), and
            question mark (?).
            The number sign (#) for preprocessor use.
            White space: the space character, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, carriage-return, and line-
            feed.
      Lines are relevant for compiler diagnostic messages and the preprocessor. They are terminated by
      carriage-return or line-feed. If both are used together, it will count as only a single line termination. For
      the remainder of this document, any of these combinations is simply referred to as a new-line. There is no
      line continuation character.
      In general, the languageâs use of this character set is case sensitive.
      There are no character or string data types, so no quoting characters are included.
      There is no end-of-file character.

3.2   Source Strings
      The source for a single shader is an array of strings of characters from the character set. A single shader
      is made from the concatenation of these strings. Each string can contain multiple lines, separated by new-
      lines. No new-lines need be present in a string; a single line can be formed from multiple strings. No
      new-lines or other characters are inserted by the implementation when it concatenates the strings to form a
      single shader. Multiple shaders can be linked together to form a single program.
      Diagnostic messages returned from compiling a shader must identify both the line number within a string
      and which source string the message applies to. Source strings are counted sequentially with the first
      string being string 0. Line numbers are one more than the number of new-lines that have been processed.




                                                        7
                                                                                                      3 Basics



3.3   Preprocessor
      There is a preprocessor that processes the source strings as part of the compilation process.
      The complete list of preprocessor directives is as follows.
         #
         #define
         #undef

         #if
         #ifdef
         #ifndef
         #else
         #elif
         #endif

         #error
         #pragma

         #extension
         #version

         #line

      The following operators are also available
         defined
         ##

      Each number sign (#) can be preceded in its line only by spaces or horizontal tabs. It may also be
      followed by spaces and horizontal tabs, preceding the directive. Each directive is terminated by a new-
      line. Preprocessing does not change the number or relative location of new-lines in a source string.
      The number sign (#) on a line by itself is ignored. Any directive not listed above will cause a diagnostic
      message and make the implementation treat the shader as ill-formed.
      #define and #undef functionality are defined as is standard for C++ preprocessors for macro definitions
      both with and without macro parameters.
      The following predefined macros are available
         __LINE__
         __FILE__
         __VERSION__

      __LINE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that is one more than the number of preceding new-
      lines in the current source string.
      __FILE__ will substitute a decimal integer constant that says which source string number is currently
      being processed.




                                                      8
                                                                                                  3 Basics



__VERSION__ will substitute a decimal integer reflecting the version number of the OpenGL shading
language. The version of the shading language described in this document will have __VERSION__
substitute the decimal integer 400.
All macro names containing two consecutive underscores ( __ ) are reserved for future use as predefined
macro names. All macro names prefixed with âGL_â (âGLâ followed by a single underscore) are also
reserved.
#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif are defined to operate as is standard for C++ preprocessors.
Expressions following #if and #elif are further restricted to expressions operating on literal integer
constants, plus identifiers consumed by the defined operator. It is an error to use #if or #elif on
expressions containing undefined macro names, other than as arguments to the defined operator.
Character constants are not supported. The operators available are as follows.


      Precedence Operator class                               Operators               Associativity
        1 (highest)    parenthetical grouping                    ()                   NA

                                                                 + - ~ !
        3              multiplicative                            * / %                Left to Right
        4              additive                                  + -                  Left to Right

        7              equality                                  == !=                Left to Right
        8              bit-wise and                              &                    Left to Right
        9              bit-wise exclusive or                     ^                    Left to Right
      10               bit-wise inclusive or                     |                    Left to Right
      11               logical and                               &&                   Left to Right
      12 (lowest)      logical inclusive or                      ||                   Left to Right


The defined operator can be used in either of the following ways:
   defined identifier
   defined ( identifier )

Two tokens in a macro can be concatenated into one token using the token pasting (##) operator, as is
standard for C++ preprocessors. The result must be a valid single token, which will then be subject to
macro expansion. That is, macro expansion happens only after token pasting. There are no other number
sign based operators (e.g., no # or #@), nor is there a sizeof operator.
The semantics of applying operators to integer literals in the preprocessor match those standard in the
C++ preprocessor, not those in the OpenGL Shading Language.




                                                9
                                                                                                3 Basics



Preprocessor expressions will be evaluated according to the behavior of the host processor, not the
processor targeted by the shader.
#error will cause the implementation to put a diagnostic message into the shader objectâs information log
(section 6.1.12 âShader and Program Queriesâ in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification for how to
access a shader objectâs information log). The message will be the tokens following the #error directive,
up to the first new-line. The implementation must then consider the shader to be ill-formed.
#pragma allows implementation dependent compiler control. Tokens following #pragma are not subject
to preprocessor macro expansion. If an implementation does not recognize the tokens following
#pragma, then it will ignore that pragma. The following pragmas are defined as part of the language.
   #pragma STDGL

The STDGL pragma is used to reserve pragmas for use by future revisions of this language. No
implementation may use a pragma whose first token is STDGL.
   #pragma optimize(on)
   #pragma optimize(off)

can be used to turn off optimizations as an aid in developing and debugging shaders. It can only be used
outside function definitions. By default, optimization is turned on for all shaders. The debug pragma
   #pragma debug(on)
   #pragma debug(off)

can be used to enable compiling and annotating a shader with debug information, so that it can be used
with a debugger. It can only be used outside function definitions. By default, debug is turned off.
Shaders should declare the version of the language they are written to. The language version a shader is
written to is specified by
   #version number profileopt

where number must be a version of the language, following the same convention as __VERSION__ above.
The directive â#version 400â is required in any shader that uses version 4.00 of the language. Any
number representing a version of the language a compiler does not support will cause an error to be
generated. Version 1.10 of the language does not require shaders to include this directive, and shaders that
do not include a #version directive will be treated as targeting version 1.10.
Shaders declaring version 1.40, 1.50, or 3.30 of the shading language can be linked with shaders declaring
version 4.00 in the same program. Shaders targeting earlier versions (1.30 or earlier) of the shading
language cannot be linked with version 4.00 shaders.

                                                                                                  3 Basics



If the optional profile argument is provided, it must be the name of an OpenGL profile. Currently, there
are two choices:
   core
   compatibility

If no profile argument is provided, the default is core. Unless otherwise specified, this specification is
documenting the core profile, and everything specified for the core profile is also available in the
compatibility profile. Features specified as belonging specifically to the compatibility profile are not
available in the core profile.
There is a built-in macro definition for each profile the implementation supports. All implementations
provide the following macro:
   #define GL_core_profile 1

Implementations providing the compatibility profile provide the following macro:
   #define GL_compatibility_profile 1

The #version directive must occur in a shader before anything else, except for comments and white space.




                                                11
                                                                                                  3 Basics



By default, compilers of this language must issue compile time syntactic, grammatical, and semantic
errors for shaders that do not conform to this specification. Any extended behavior must first be enabled.
Directives to control the behavior of the compiler with respect to extensions are declared with the
#extension directive
   #extension extension_name : behavior
   #extension all : behavior

where extension_name is the name of an extension. Extension names are not documented in this
specification. The token all means the behavior applies to all extensions supported by the compiler. The
behavior can be one of the following

 behavior                  Effect
         require           Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Give an error on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not
                           supported, or if all is specified.


         enable            Behave as specified by the extension extension_name.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.
                           Give an error on the #extension if all is specified.


          warn             Behave as specified by the extension extension_name, except issue warnings
                           on any detectable use of that extension, unless such use is supported by other
                           enabled or required extensions.
                           If all is specified, then warn on all detectable uses of any extension used.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.


         disable           Behave (including issuing errors and warnings) as if the extension
                           extension_name is not part of the language definition.
                           If all is specified, then behavior must revert back to that of the non-extended
                           core version of the language being compiled to.
                           Warn on the #extension if the extension extension_name is not supported.



The extension directive is a simple, low-level mechanism to set the behavior for each extension. It does
not define policies such as which combinations are appropriate, those must be defined elsewhere. Order
of directives matters in setting the behavior for each extension: Directives that occur later override those
seen earlier. The all variant sets the behavior for all extensions, overriding all previously issued
extension directives, but only for the behaviors warn and disable.




                                               12
                                                                                                       3 Basics



      The initial state of the compiler is as if the directive
         #extension all : disable

      was issued, telling the compiler that all error and warning reporting must be done according to this
      specification, ignoring any extensions.
      Each extension can define its allowed granularity of scope. If nothing is said, the granularity is a shader
      (that is, a single compilation unit), and the extension directives must occur before any non-preprocessor
      tokens. If necessary, the linker can enforce granularities larger than a single compilation unit, in which
      case each involved shader will have to contain the necessary extension directive.
      Macro expansion is not done on lines containing #extension and #version directives.
      #line must have, after macro substitution, one of the following forms:
         #line line
         #line line source-string-number

      where line and source-string-number are constant integer expressions. After processing this directive
      (including its new-line), the implementation will behave as if it is compiling at line number line and
      source string number source-string-number. Subsequent source strings will be numbered sequentially,
      until another #line directive overrides that numbering.

3.4   Comments
      Comments are delimited by /* and */, or by // and a new-line. The begin comment delimiters (/* or //) are
      not recognized as comment delimiters inside of a comment, hence comments cannot be nested. If a
      comment resides entirely within a single line, it is treated syntactically as a single space. New-lines are
      not eliminated by comments.

3.5   Tokens
      The language is a sequence of tokens. A token can be

           token:
                keyword
                identifier
                integer-constant
                floating-constant
                operator
                ; { }

3.6   Keywords
      The following are the keywords in the language, and cannot be used for any other purpose than that
      defined by this document:
              attribute const uniform varying
              layout

      keywords.

3.7   Identifiers
      Identifiers are used for variable names, function names, structure names, and field selectors (field
      selectors select components of vectors and matrices similar to structure fields, as discussed in section 5.5
      âVector Componentsâ and section 5.6 âMatrix Componentsâ ). Identifiers have the form

           identifier
                nondigit
                identifier nondigit
                identifier digit

             digit: one of
                   0123456789


        Identifiers starting with âgl_â are reserved for use by OpenGL, and may not be declared in a shader as
        either a variable or a function. However, as noted in the specification, there are some cases where
        previously declared variables can be redeclared to change or add some property, and predeclared "gl_"
        names are allowed to be redeclared in a shader only for these specific purposes. More generally, it is an
        error to redeclare a variable, including those starting âgl_â.

3.8     Definitions
        Some language rules described below depend on the following definitions.

3.8.1   Static Use
        A shader contains a static use of (or static assignment to) a variable x if, after preprocessing, the shader
        contains a statement that would read (or write) x, whether or not run-time flow of control will cause that
        statement to be executed.

3.8.2   Uniform and Non-Uniform Control Flow
        When executing statements in a fragment shader, control flow starts as uniform control flow; all fragments
        enter the same control path into main(). Control flow becomes non-uniform when different fragments
        take different paths through control-flow statements (selection, iteration, and jumps). Control flow
        subsequently returns to being uniform after such divergent sub-statements or skipped code completes,
        until the next time different control paths are taken.
        For example:
           main()
           {
               float a = ...;//          this is uniform flow control
               if (a < b) { //           this expression is true for some fragments, not all
                   ....;     //          non-uniform flow control
               } else {
                   ....;     //          non-uniform flow control
               }
               ....;         //          uniform flow control again
           }

        Other examples of non-uniform flow control can occur within switch statements and after conditional
        breaks, continues, early returns, and after fragment discards, when the condition is true for some
        fragments but not others. Loop iterations that only some fragments execute are also non-uniform flow
        control.

                                                                                                          3 Basics



        This is similarly defined for other shader stages, based on the per-instance data items they process.

3.8.3   Dynamically Uniform Expressions
        A fragment-shader expression is dynamically uniform if all fragments evaluating it get the same resulting
        value. When loops are involved, this refers to the expression's value for the same loop iteration. When
        functions are involved, this refers to calls from the same call point.
        This is similarly defined for other shader stages, based on the per-instance data they process.
        Note that constant expressions are trivially dynamically uniform. It follows that typical loop counters
        based on these are also dynamically uniform.

4 Variables and Types

      All variables and functions must be declared before being used. Variable and function names are
      identifiers.
      There are no default types. All variable and function declarations must have a declared type, and
      optionally qualifiers. A variable is declared by specifying its type followed by one or more names
      separated by commas. In many cases, a variable can be initialized as part of its declaration by using the
      assignment operator (=). The grammar near the end of this document provides a full reference for the
      syntax of declaring variables.
      User-defined types may be defined using struct to aggregate a list of existing types into a single name.
      The OpenGL Shading Language is type safe. There are no implicit conversions between types, with the
      exception that an integer value may appear where a floating-point type is expected, and be converted to a
      floating-point value. Exactly how and when this can occur is described in section 4.1.10 âImplicit
      Conversionsâ and as referenced by other sections in this specification.

4.1   Basic Types

             usamplerCubeArray            a handle for accessing an unsigned integer cube map array texture

        In addition, a shader can aggregate these using arrays and structures to build more complex types.
        There are no pointer types.

4.1.1   Void
        Functions that do not return a value must be declared as void. There is no default function return type.
        The keyword void cannot be used in any other declarations (except for empty formal or actual parameter
        lists).

4.1.2   Booleans
        To make conditional execution of code easier to express, the type bool is supported. There is no
        expectation that hardware directly supports variables of this type. It is a genuine Boolean type, holding
        only one of two values meaning either true or false. Two keywords true and false can be used as literal
        Boolean constants. Booleans are declared and optionally initialized as in the follow example:
           bool success;      // declare âsuccessâ to be a Boolean
           bool done = false; // declare and initialize âdoneâ

        The right side of the assignment operator ( = ) must be an expression whose type is bool.
        Expressions used for conditional jumps (if, for, ?:, while, do-while) must evaluate to the type bool.




                                                       21
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.3   Integers
        Signed and unsigned integer variables are fully supported. In this document, the term integer is meant to
        generally include both signed and unsigned integers. Unsigned integers have exactly 32 bits of precision.
        Signed integers use 32 bits, including a sign bit, in two's complement form. Operations resulting in
        overflow or underflow will not cause any exception, nor will they saturate, rather they will âwrapâ to yield
        the low-order 32 bits of the result.
        Integers are declared and optionally initialized with integer expressions, as in the following example:
           int i, j = 42;        // default integer literal type is int
           uint k = 3u;          // âuâ establishes the type as uint

                                                                               4 Variables and Types



Literal integer constants can be expressed in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16)
as follows.

     integer-constant :
          decimal-constant integer-suffixopt
          octal-constant integer-suffixopt
          hexadecimal-constant integer-suffixopt
     integer-suffix: one of
          u U
     decimal-constant :
         nonzero-digit
         decimal-constant digit
     octal-constant :
          0
          octal-constant octal-digit
     hexadecimal-constant :
         0x hexadecimal-digit
         0X hexadecimal-digit
         hexadecimal-constant hexadecimal-digit
     digit :
           0
           nonzero-digit
     nonzero-digit : one of
         123456789
     octal-digit : one of
          01234567
     hexadecimal-digit : one of
         0123456789
         abcdef
         ABCDEF
No white space is allowed between the digits of an integer constant, including after the leading 0 or after
the leading 0x or 0X of a constant, or before the suffix u or U. When the suffix u or U is present, the
literal has type uint, otherwise the type is int. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted as an
arithmetic unary negation, not as part of the constant.
It is an error to provide a literal integer whose magnitude is too large to store in a variable of matching
signed or unsigned type.

                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.4   Floats
        Single-precision and double-precision floating point variables are available for use in a variety of scalar
        calculations. Floating-point variables are defined as in the following example:
           float a, b = 1.5;
           double c, d = 2.0LF;

        As an input value to one of the processing units, a single-precision or double-precision floating-point
        variable is expected to match the corresponding IEEE 754 floating-point definition for precision and
        dynamic range. Floating-point variables within a shader are also encoded according to the IEEE 754
        specification for single-precision floating-point values. However, it is not required that the precision of
        internal processing match the IEEE 754 floating-point specification for floating-point operations, but the
        guidelines for precision established by the OpenGL Graphics System Specification must be met.
        Similarly, treatment of conditions such as divide by 0 may lead to an unspecified result, but in no case
        should such a condition lead to the interruption or termination of processing. Generally, there are no
        signaling NaNs, and operating on NaNs (Not a Number) or infs (positive or negative infinities) gives
        undefined results.
        Floating-point constants are defined as follows.

             floating-constant :
                   fractional-constant exponent-partopt floating-suffixopt
                  digit-sequence exponent-part floating-suffixopt
             fractional-constant :
                  digit-sequence . digit-sequence
                  digit-sequence .
                  . digit-sequence
             exponent-part :
                 e signopt digit-sequence
                 E signopt digit-sequence

             sign : one of
                  +â
             digit-sequence :
                   digit
                   digit-sequence digit
             floating-suffix: one of
                   f F lf LF
        A decimal point ( . ) is not needed if the exponent part is present. No white space may appear anywhere
        within a floating-point constant, including before a suffix. When the suffix "lf" or "LF" is present, the
        literal has type double. Otherwise, the literal has type float. A leading unary minus sign (-) is interpreted
        as a unary operator and is not part of the floating-point constant




                                                        24
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



4.1.5   Vectors
        The OpenGL Shading Language includes data types for generic 2-, 3-, and 4-component vectors of
        floating-point values, integers, or Booleans. Floating-point vector variables can be used to store colors,
        normals, positions, texture coordinates, texture lookup results and the like. Boolean vectors can be used
        for component-wise comparisons of numeric vectors. Some examples of vector declaration are:
           vec2 texcoord1, texcoord2;
           vec3 position;
           vec4 myRGBA;
           ivec2 textureLookup;
           bvec3 less;

        Initialization of vectors can be done with constructors, which are discussed shortly.

4.1.6   Matrices
        The OpenGL Shading Language has built-in types for 2Ã2, 2Ã3, 2Ã4, 3Ã2, 3Ã3, 3Ã4, 4Ã2, 4Ã3, and 4Ã4
        matrices of floating-point numbers. Matrix types beginning with "mat" have single-precision components
        while matrix types beginning with "dmat" have double-precision components. The first number in the
        type is the number of columns, the second is the number of rows. If there is only one number, the matrix
        is square. Example matrix declarations:
           mat2 mat2D;
           mat3 optMatrix;
           mat4 view, projection;
           mat4x4 view; // an alternate way of declaring a mat4
           mat3x2 m;     // a matrix with 3 columns and 2 rows
           dmat4 highPrecisionMVP;
           dmat2x4 dm;

        Initialization of matrix values is done with constructors (described in section 5.4 âConstructorsâ ) in
        column-major order.

4.1.7   Samplers
        Sampler types (e.g., sampler2D) are effectively opaque handles to textures and their filters. They are
        used with the built-in texture functions (described in section 8.7 âTexture Lookup Functionsâ ) to specify
        which texture to access and how it is to be filtered. They can only be declared as function parameters or
        uniform variables (see section 4.3.5 âUniformâ ). Except for array indexing, structure field selection, and
        parentheses, samplers are not allowed to be operands in expressions. Samplers aggregated into arrays
        within a shader (using square brackets [ ]) can only be indexed with a dynamically uniform integral
        expression, otherwise results are undefined. Samplers cannot be treated as l-values; hence cannot be used
        as out or inout function parameters, nor can they be assigned into. As uniforms, they are initialized only
        with the OpenGL API; they cannot be declared with an initializer in a shader. As function parameters,
        only samplers may be passed to samplers of matching type. This enables consistency checking between
        shader texture accesses and OpenGL texture state before a shader is run.

                                                                                     4 Variables and Types



4.1.8   Structures
        User-defined types can be created by aggregating other already defined types into a structure using the
        struct keyword. For example,
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           } lightVar;

        In this example, light becomes the name of the new type, and lightVar becomes a variable of type light.
        To declare variables of the new type, use its name (without the keyword struct).
           light lightVar2;

        More formally, structures are declared as follows. However, the complete correct grammar is as given in
        section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ .

             struct-definition :
                  qualifieropt struct nameopt { member-list } declaratorsopt ;

             member-list :
                member-declaration;
                member-declaration member-list;
             member-declaration :
                basic-type declarators;
        where name becomes the user-defined type, and can be used to declare variables to be of this new type.
        The name shares the same name space as other variables, types, and functions. All previously visible
        variables, types, constructors, or functions with that name are hidden. The optional qualifier only applies
        to any declarators, and is not part of the type being defined for name.
        Structures must have at least one member declaration. Member declarators may contain precision
        qualifiers, but may not contain any other qualifiers. Bit fields are not supported. Member types must be
        already defined (there are no forward references). Member declarations cannot contain initializers.
        Member declarators can contain arrays. Such arrays must have a size specified, and the size must be an
        integral constant expression that's greater than zero (see section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ). Each
        level of structure has its own name space for names given in member declarators; such names need only
        be unique within that name space.




                                                        26
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Anonymous structures are not supported. Embedded structure definitions are not supported.
           struct S { float f; };

           struct T {
                  S;              // Error: anonymous structures disallowed
                  struct { ... }; // Error: embedded structures disallowed
                  S s;            // Okay: nested structures with name are allowed
           };

        Structures can be initialized at declaration time using constructors, as discussed in section 5.4.3 âStructure
        Constructorsâ .

4.1.9   Arrays
        Variables of the same type can be aggregated into arrays by declaring a name followed by brackets ( [ ] )
        enclosing an optional size. When an array size is specified in a declaration, it must be an integral constant
        expression (see section 4.3.3 âConstant Expressionsâ ) greater than zero. If an array is indexed with an
        expression that is not an integral constant expression, or if an array is passed as an argument to a function,
        then its size must be declared before any such use. It is legal to declare an array without a size and then
        later re-declare the same name as an array of the same type and specify a size. It is illegal to declare an
        array with a size, and then later (in the same shader) index the same array with an integral constant
        expression greater than or equal to the declared size. It is also illegal to index an array with a negative
        constant expression. Arrays declared as formal parameters in a function declaration must specify a size.
        Undefined behavior results from indexing an array with a non-constant expression thatâs greater than or
        equal to the arrayâs size or less than 0. Only one-dimensional arrays may be declared. All basic types and
        structures can be formed into arrays. Some examples are:
           float frequencies[3];
           uniform vec4 lightPosition[4];
           light lights[];
           const int numLights = 2;
           light lights[numLights];

        An array type can be formed by specifying a type followed by square brackets ([ ]) and including a size:
           float[5]

        This type can be used anywhere any other type can be used, including as the return value from a function
           float[5] foo() { }

        as a constructor of an array
           float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1)

        as an unnamed parameter
           void foo(float[5])




                                                        27
                                                                                4 Variables and Types




and as an alternate way of declaring a variable or function parameter.
   float[5] a;

It is an error to declare arrays of arrays:
   float a[5][3];          // illegal
   float[5] a[3];          // illegal


Arrays can have initializers formed from array constructors:
   float a[5] = float[5](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1);
   float a[5] = float[](3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 1.1); // same thing

Unsized arrays can be explicitly sized by an initializer at declaration time:
   float a[5];
   ...
   float b[] = a; // b is explicitly size 5
   float b[5] = a; // means the same thing

However, implicitly sized arrays cannot be assigned to. Note, this is a rare case that initializers and
assignments appear to have different semantics.
Arrays know the number of elements they contain. This can be obtained by using the length method:
   a.length();        // returns 5 for the above declarations

The length method cannot be called on an array that has not been explicitly sized.

      There are no implicit array or structure conversions. For example, an array of int cannot be implicitly
      converted to an array of float.
      When an implicit conversion is done, it is not a re-interpretation of the expression's bit pattern, but a
      conversion of its value to an equivalent value in the new type. For example, the integer value -5 will be
      converted to the floating-point value -5.0. Integer values having more bits of precision than a floating
      point mantissa will lose precision when converted to float.
      When performing implicit conversion for binary operators, there may be multiple data types to which the
      two operands can be converted. For example, when adding an int value to a uint value, both values can
      be implicitly converted to uint, float, and double. In such cases, a floating-point type is chosen if either
      operand has a floating-point type. Otherwise, an unsigned integer type is chosen if either operand has an
      unsigned integer type. Otherwise, a signed integer type is chosen. If operands can be implicitly converted
      to multiple data types deriving from the same base data type, the type with the smallest component size is
      used.
      The conversions in the table above are done only as indicated by other sections of this specification.

4.2   Scoping
      The scope of a variable is determined by where it is declared. If it is declared outside all function
      definitions, it has global scope, which starts from where it is declared and persists to the end of the shader
      it is declared in. If it is declared in a while test or a for statement, then it is scoped to the end of the
      following sub-statement. Otherwise, if it is declared as a statement within a compound statement, it is
      scoped to the end of that compound statement. If it is declared as a parameter in a function definition, it is
      scoped until the end of that function definition. A function body has a scope nested inside the functionâs
      definition. The if statementâs expression does not allow new variables to be declared, hence does not
      form a new scope.




                                                      30
                                                                              4 Variables and Types



Within a declaration, the scope of a name starts immediately after the initializer if present or immediately
after the name being declared if not. Several examples:
   int x = 1;
   {
          int x = 2, y = x; // y is initialized to 2
   }

   struct S
   {
          int x;
   };

   {
            S S = S(0);         // 'S' is only visible as a struct and constructor
            S;                  // 'S' is now visible as a variable
   }

   int x = x;                  // Error if x has not been previously defined.

All variable names, structure type names, and function names in a given scope share the same name space.
Function names can be redeclared in the same scope, with the same or different parameters, without error.
An implicitly sized array can be re-declared in the same scope as an array of the same base type.
Otherwise, within one compilation unit, a declared name cannot be redeclared in the same scope; doing so
results in a redeclaration error. If a nested scope redeclares a name used in an outer scope, it hides all
existing uses of that name. There is no way to access the hidden name or make it unhidden, without
exiting the scope that hid it.
The built-in functions are scoped in a scope outside the global scope users declare global variables in.
That is, a shader's global scope, available for user-defined functions and global variables, is nested inside
the scope containing the built-in functions. When a function name is redeclared in a nested scope, it hides
all functions declared with that name in the outer scope. Function declarations (prototypes) cannot occur
inside of functions; they must be at global scope, or for the built-in functions, outside the global scope.
Shared globals are global variables declared with the same name in independently compiled units
(shaders) within the same language (e.g., vertex) that are linked together when making a single program.
(Globals forming the interface between two different shader languages are discussed in other sections.)
Shared globals share the same name space, and must be declared with the same type. They will share the
same storage. Shared global arrays must have the same base type and the same explicit size. An array
implicitly sized in one shader can be explicitly sized by another shader. If no shader has an explicit size
for the array, the largest implicit size is used. Scalars must have exactly the same type name and type
definition. Structures must have the same name, sequence of type names, and type definitions, and field
names to be considered the same type. This rule applies recursively for nested or embedded types. All
initializers for a shared global must have the same value, or a link error will result.

4.3   Storage Qualifiers
      Variable declarations may have one storage qualifier specified in front of the type. These are summarized
      as

             Qualifier                Meaning
             < none: default >        local read/write memory, or an input parameter to a function
             const                    a compile-time constant, or a function parameter that is read-only
             in                       linkage into a shader from a previous stage, variable is copied in
             centroid in              linkage with centroid based interpolation
             sample in                input linkage with per-sample interpolation
             out                      linkage out of a shader to a subsequent stage, variable is copied out
             centroid out             linkage with centroid based interpolation
             sample out               output linkage with per-sample interpolation
             attribute                deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and OpenGL for per-vertex
                                      data
             uniform                  value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms
                                      form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application
             varying                  deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and a fragment shader for
             centroid varying         interpolated data
             patch in                 tessellation evaluation shader input for per-patch attributes
             patch out                tessellation control shader output for per-patch attributes


      Outputs from shader (out) and inputs to a shader (in) can be further qualified with one of these
      interpolation qualifiers

             Qualifier                    Meaning
             smooth                       perspective correct interpolation
             flat                         no interpolation
             noperspective                linear interpolation


      These interpolation qualifiers may only precede the qualifiers in, centroid in, sample in, out, centroid
      out, or sample out in a declaration. They do not apply to the deprecated storage qualifiers varying or
      centroid varying. They also do not apply to inputs into a vertex shader or outputs from a fragment
      shader.


      Local variables can only use the const storage qualifier.
      Function parameters can use const, in, and out qualifiers, but as parameter qualifiers. Parameter
      qualifiers are discussed in section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.
      Function return types and structure fields do not use storage qualifiers.




                                                      32
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        Data types for communication from one run of a shader executable to its next run (to communicate
        between fragments or between vertices) do not exist. This would prevent parallel execution of the same
        shader executable on multiple vertices or fragments.
        Initializers may only be used in declarations of globals with no storage qualifier, with a const qualifier or
        with a uniform qualifier. Global variables without storage qualifiers that are not initialized in their
        declaration or by the application will not be initialized by OpenGL, but rather will enter main() with
        undefined values.

4.3.1   Default Storage Qualifier
        If no qualifier is present on a global variable, then the variable has no linkage to the application or shaders
        running on other pipeline stages. For either global or local unqualified variables, the declaration will
        appear to allocate memory associated with the processor it targets. This variable will provide read/write
        access to this allocated memory.

4.3.2   Constant Qualifier
        Named compile-time constants can be declared using the const qualifier. Any variables qualified as
        constant are read-only variables for that shader. Declaring variables as constant allows more descriptive
        shaders than using hard-wired numerical constants. The const qualifier can be used with any of the basic
        data types. It is an error to write to a const variable outside of its declaration, so they must be initialized
        when declared. For example,
            const vec3 zAxis = vec3 (0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

        Structure fields may not be qualified with const. Structure variables can be declared as const, and
        initialized with a structure constructor.
        Initializers for const declarations must be constant expressions, as defined in section 4.3.3 âConstant
        Expressions.â

4.3.3   Constant Expressions
        A constant expression is one of
        â¢   a literal value (e.g., 5 or true)
        â¢   a global or local variable qualified as const (i.e., not including function parameters)
        â¢   an expression formed by an operator on operands that are all constant expressions, including getting an
            element or length of a constant array, or a field of a constant structure, or components of a constant
            vector.
        â¢   a constructor whose arguments are all constant expressions
        â¢   a built-in function call whose arguments are all constant expressions, with the exception of the texture
            lookup functions and the noise functions. The built-in functions dFdx, dFdy, and fwidth must return
            0 when evaluated inside an initializer with an argument that is a constant expression.
        Function calls to user-defined functions (non-built-in functions) cannot be used to form constant
        expressions.




                                                         33
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        An integral constant expression is a constant expression that evaluates to a scalar signed or unsigned
        integer.
        Constant expressions will be evaluated in an invariant way so as to create the same value in multiple
        shaders when the same constant expressions appear in those shaders. See section 4.6.1 âThe Invariant
        Qualifierâ for more details on how to create invariant expressions.

4.3.4   Inputs
        Shader input variables are declared with a storage qualifier using the keyword in. They form the input
        interface between previous stages of the OpenGL pipeline and the declaring shader. Input variables must
        be declared at global scope. Values from the previous pipeline stage are copied into input variables at the
        beginning of shader execution. Variables declared as inputs cannot be written to during shader execution.
        Only the input variables that are actually read need to be written by the previous stage; it is allowed to
        have superfluous declarations of input variables.
        See section 7 âBuilt-in Variablesâ for a list of the built-in input names.
        Vertex shader input variables (or attributes) receive per-vertex data. They are declared in a vertex shader
        with the in qualifier or the deprecated attribute qualifier. It is an error to use any other input storage
        qualifier or any interpolation qualifiers as a vertex shader input. The values copied in are established by
        the OpenGL API or through the use of the layout identifier location. It is an error to use attribute in a
        non-vertex shader. Vertex shader inputs can only be single-precision floating-point scalars, single-
        precision floating-point vectors, matrices, signed and unsigned integers and integer vectors. Vertex
        shader inputs can also form arrays of these types, but not structures. There are no double-precision
        floating-point input types in the vertex shading language.
        Example declarations in a vertex shader:
           in vec4 position;
           in vec3 normal;
           in vec2 texCoord[4];

        It is expected that graphics hardware will have a small number of fixed vector locations for passing vertex
        inputs. Therefore, the OpenGL Shading language defines each non-matrix input variable as taking up one
        such vector location. There is an implementation dependent limit on the number of locations that can be
        used, and if this is exceeded it will cause a link error. (Declared input variables that are not statically used
        do not count against this limit.) A scalar input counts the same amount against this limit as a vec4, so
        applications may want to consider packing groups of four unrelated float inputs together into a vector to
        better utilize the capabilities of the underlying hardware. A matrix input will use up multiple locations.
        The number of locations used will equal the number of columns in the matrix.




                                                         34
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



Tessellation control, evaluation, and geometry shader input variables get the per-vertex values written out
by output variables of the same names in the previous active shader stage. For these inputs, centroid in
and interpolation qualifiers are allowed, but have no effect. Since tessellation control, tessellation
evaluation, and geometry shaders operate on a set of vertices, each input varying variable (or input block,
see interface blocks below) needs to be declared as an array. For example,
   in float foo[];             // geometry shader input for vertex âout float fooâ

Each element of such an array corresponds to one vertex of the primitive being processed. Each array can
optionally have a size declared. The array size will be set by, (or if provided must be consistent with) the
input layout declaration(s) establishing the type of input primitive, as described later in section 4.3.8.1
âInput Layout Qualifiersâ.
Some inputs and outputs are arrayed, meaning that for an interface between two shader stages either the
input or output declaration requires an extra level of array indexing for the declarations to match. For
example, with the interface between a vertex shader and a geometry shader, vertex shader output variables
and geometry shader input variables of the same name must match in type and qualification, except that
the vertex shader name cannot be declared as an array while the geometry shader name must be declared
as an array, to allow for vertex indexing. It is a link error if a non-arrayed input is not declared with the
same type, qualification, and array dimensionality as the matching output. It is an error if an arrayed input
is not declared as an array of the same type and qualification as the corresponding (non-array) output.
Symmetrically, it is an error if an arrayed output is not declared as an array of the same type and
qualification as the corresponding (non-array) input.
If the output corresponding to an arrayed input is itself an array, it must appear in an output block (see
interface blocks below) in the outputting shader and in an input block in the inputting shader with a block
instance name declared as an array. This is required because two-dimensional arrays are not supported.
Additionally, tessellation evaluation shaders support per-patch input variables declared with the patch in
qualifier. Per-patch input variables are filled with the values of per-patch output variables written by the
tessellation control shader. Per-patch inputs may be declared as one-dimensional arrays, but are not
indexed by vertex number. Input variables may not be declared using the patch in qualifier in tessellation
control or geometry shaders. As with other input variables, per-patch inputs must be declared using the
same type and qualification as per-patch outputs from the previous (tessellation control) shader stage.
Fragment shader inputs get per-fragment values, typically interpolated from a previous stage's outputs.
They are declared in fragment shaders with the in storage qualifier, the centroid in storage qualifier, or
the deprecated varying and centroid varying storage qualifiers. It is an error to use patch in in a
fragment shader. Fragment inputs can only be signed and unsigned integers and integer vectors, floating
point scalars, floating-point vectors, matrices, or arrays or structures of these. Fragment shader inputs that
are signed or unsigned integers, integer vectors, or any double-precision floating-point type must be
qualified with the interpolation qualifier flat.




                                                35
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        Fragment inputs are declared as in the following examples:
           in vec3 normal;
           centroid in vec2 TexCoord;
           invariant centroid in vec4 Color;
           noperspective in float temperature;
           flat in vec3 myColor;
           noperspective centroid in vec2 myTexCoord;

        The fragment shader inputs form an interface with the last active shader in the vertex processing pipeline.
        For this interface, the last active shader stage output variables and fragment shader input variables of the
        same name must match in type and qualification (other than out matching to in).

4.3.5   Uniform
        The uniform qualifier is used to declare global variables whose values are the same across the entire
        primitive being processed. All uniform variables are read-only and are initialized externally either at link
        time or through the API. The link time initial value is either the value of the variable's initializer, if
        present, or 0 if no initializer is present. Sampler types cannot have initializers.
        Example declarations are:
           uniform vec4 lightPosition;
           uniform vec3 color = vec3(0.7, 0.7, 0.2);                    // value assigned at link time

        The uniform qualifier can be used with any of the basic data types, or when declaring a variable whose
        type is a structure, or an array of any of these.
        There is an implementation dependent limit on the amount of storage for uniforms that can be used for
        each type of shader and if this is exceeded it will cause a compile-time or link-time error. Uniform
        variables that are declared but not used do not count against this limit. The number of user-defined
        uniform variables and the number of built-in uniform variables that are used within a shader are added
        together to determine whether available uniform storage has been exceeded.
        If multiple shaders are linked together, then they will share a single global uniform name space, including
        within a language as well as across languages. Hence, the types and initializers of uniform variables with
        the same name must match across all shaders that are linked into a single program.
        It is legal for some shaders to provide an initializer for a particular uniform variable, while another shader
        does not, but all provided initializers must be equal.

4.3.6   Outputs
        Shader output variables are declared with a storage qualifier using the keyword out. They form the output
        interface between the declaring shader and the subsequent stages of the OpenGL pipeline. Output
        variables must be declared at global scope. During shader execution they will behave as normal
        unqualified global variables. Their values are copied out to the subsequent pipeline stage on shader exit.
        Only output variables that are read by the subsequent pipeline stage need to be written; it is allowed to
        have superfluous declarations of output variables.




                                                        36
                                                                                  4 Variables and Types



There is not an inout storage qualifier at global scope for declaring a single variable name as both input
and output to a shader. Output variables must be declared with different names than input variables.
However, nesting an input or output inside an interface block with an instance name allows the same
names with one referenced through a block instance name.
Vertex, tessellation evaluation, and geometry output variables output per-vertex data and are declared
using the out, centroid out, or sample out storage qualifiers, or the deprecated varying storage qualifier.
It is an error to use patch out in a vertex, tessellation evaluation, or geometry shader. Output variables
can only be floating-point scalars, floating-point vectors, matrices, signed or unsigned integers or integer
vectors, or arrays or structures of any these.
Individual vertex, tessellation evaluation, and geometry outputs are declared as in the following examples:
   out vec3 normal;
   centroid out vec2 TexCoord;
   invariant centroid out vec4 Color;
   noperspective out float temperature; // varying is deprecated
   flat out vec3 myColor;
   noperspective centroid out vec2 myTexCoord;
   sample out vec4 perSampleColor;

These can also appear in interface blocks, as described in section 4.3.7 âInterface Blocksâ. Interface
blocks allow simpler addition of arrays to the interface from vertex to geometry shader. They also allow a
fragment shader to have the same input interface as a geometry shader for a given vertex shader.
Tessellation control shader output variables are may be used to output per-vertex and per-patch data. Per-
vertex output variables are arrayed (see arrayed under 4.3.4 Inputs) and declared using out or centroid
out storage qualifiers. Per-patch output variables are declared using the patch out storage qualifier. Per-
vertex and per-patch output variables can only be floating-point scalars, floating-point vectors, matrices,
signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays or structures of any these. Since tessellation
control shaders produce an arrayed primitive comprising multiple vertices, each per-vertex output variable
(or output block, see interface blocks below) needs to be declared as an array. For example,
   out float foo[];           // feeds next stage input âin float foo[]â

Each element of such an array corresponds to one vertex of the primitive being produced. Each array can
optionally have a size declared. The array size will be set by (or if provided must be consistent with) the
output layout declaration(s) establishing the number of vertices in the output patch, as described later in
section 4.3.8.2 âOutput Layout Qualifiersâ.
As described under the section 4.3.4 âInputsâ above, if a per-vertex output of the tessellation control
shader is itself an array with multiple values per vertex, it must appear in an output block (see interface
blocks below) in the tessellation control shader with a block instance name declared as an array.
Each tessellation control shader invocation has a corresponding output patch vertex, and may assign
values to per-vertex outputs only if they belong to that corresponding vertex. If a per-vertex output
variable is used as an l-value, it is an error if the expression indicating the vertex index is not the identifier
gl_InvocationID.




                                                 37
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



        The order of execution of a tessellation control shader invocation relative to the other invocations for the
        same input patch is undefined unless the built-in function barrier() is used. This provides some control
        over relative execution order. When a shader invocation calls barrier(), its execution pauses until all
        other invocations have reached the same point of execution. Output variable assignments performed by
        any invocation executed prior to calling barrier() will be visible to any other invocation after the call to
        barrier() returns.
        Because tessellation control shader invocations execute in undefined order between barriers, the values of
        per-vertex or per-patch output variables will sometimes be undefined. Consider the beginning and end of
        shader execution and each call to barrier() as synchronization points. The value of an output variable
        will be undefined in any of the three following cases:
        1. At the beginning of execution.
        2. At each synchronization point, unless
               â¢  the value was well-defined after the previous synchronization point and was not written by any
                  invocation since, or
             â¢    the value was written by exactly one shader invocation since the previous synchronization
                  point, or
             â¢    the value was written by multiple shader invocations since the previous synchronization point,
                  and the last write performed by all such invocations wrote the same value.
        3. When read by a shader invocation, if
               â¢    the value was undefined at the previous synchronization point and has not been writen by the
                    same shader invocation since, or
               â¢    the output variable is written to by any other shader invocation between the previous and next
                    synchronization points, even if that assignment occurs in code following the read.

        Fragment outputs output per-fragment data and are declared using the out storage qualifier. It is an error
        to use centroid out, sample out, or patch out in a fragment shader. Fragment outputs can only be float,
        floating-point vectors, signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays of any these. Matrices and
        structures cannot be output. Fragment outputs are declared as in the following examples:
           out vec4 FragmentColor;
           out uint Luminosity;

4.3.7   Interface Blocks
        Input, output, and uniform variable declarations can be grouped into named interface blocks to provide
        coarser granularity backing than is achievable with individual declarations. They can have an optional
        instance name, used in the shader to reference their members. An output block of one programmable
        stage is backed by a corresponding input block in the subsequent programmable stage. A uniform block is
        backed by the application with a buffer object. It is illegal to have an input block in a vertex shader or an
        output block in a fragment shader; these uses are reserved for future use.
        An interface block is started by an in, out, or uniform keyword, followed by a block name, followed by
        an open curly brace ( { ) as follows:
             interface-block :
                   layout-qualifieropt interface-qualifier block-name { member-list } instance-nameopt ;




                                                       38
                                                                              4 Variables and Types



     layout-qualifier :
          layout ( layout-qualifier-id-list )
     interface-qualifier :
           in
           out
           uniform
     layout-qualifier-id-list
          comma separated list of layout-qualifier-id
     member-list :
         member-declaration
         member-declaration member-list
     member-declaration :
         layout-qualifieropt qualifiersopt type declarators ;
     instance-name :
           identifier
           identifier [ ]
           identifier [ integral-constant-expression ]
Each of the above elements is discussed below, with the exception of layout qualifiers (layout-qualifier),
which are defined in the next section.
First, an example,
    uniform Transform {
        mat4 ModelViewMatrix;
        mat4 ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
        uniform mat3 NormalMatrix;                       // allowed restatement of qualifier
        float Deformation;
    };

The above establishes a uniform block named âTransformâ with four uniforms grouped inside it.
Types and declarators are the same as for other input, output, and uniform variable declarations outside
blocks, with these exceptions:
â¢   initializers are not allowed
â¢   sampler types are not allowed
â¢   structure definitions cannot be nested inside a block
Otherwise, built-in types, previously declared structures, and arrays of these are allowed as the type of a
declarator in the same manner they are allowed outside a block.




                                                39
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



If no optional qualifier is used in a member-declaration, the qualification of the variable is just in, out, or
uniform as determined by interface-qualifier. If optional qualifiers are used, they can include
interpolation and storage qualifiers and they must declare an input, output, or uniform variable consistent
with the interface qualifier of the block: Input variables, output variables, and uniform variables can only
be in in blocks, out blocks, and uniform blocks, respectively. Repeating the in, out, or uniform
interface qualifier for a member's storage qualifier is optional. Declarations using the deprecated
attribute and varying qualifiers are not allowed. For example,
    in Material {
        smooth in vec4 Color1; // legal, input inside in block
        smooth vec4 Color2;    // legal, 'in' inherited from 'in Material'
        vec2 TexCoord;         // legal, TexCoord is an input
        uniform float Atten;   // illegal, mismatched interfaces
        varying vec2 TexCoord2;//illegal, deprecated keywords don't get new uses
    };

For this section, define an interface to be one of these
â¢   All the uniforms of a program. This spans all compilation units linked together within one program.
â¢   The boundary between adjacent programmable pipeline stages: This spans all the outputs in all
    compilation units of the first stage and all the inputs in all compilation units of the second stage.
The block name (block-name) is used to match interfaces: an output block of one pipeline stage will be
matched to an input block with the same name in the subsequent pipeline stage. For uniform blocks, the
application uses the block name to identify the block. Block names have no other use within a shader
beyond interface matching; it is an error to use a block name at global scope for anything other than as a
block name (e.g., use of a block name for a global variable name or function name is currently reserved).
Matched block names within an interface (as defined above) must match in terms of having the same
number of declarations with the same sequence of types and the same sequence of member names, as well
as having the same member-wise layout qualification (see next section). Furthermore, if a matching block
is declared as an array, then the array sizes must also match (or follow array matching rules for the
interface between a vertex and a geometry shader). Any mismatch will generate a link error. A block
name is allowed to have different definitions in different interfaces within the same shader, allowing, for
example, an input block and output block to have the same name.




                                                40
                                                                            4 Variables and Types



If an instance name (instance-name) is not used, the names declared inside the block are scoped at the
global level and accessed as if they were declared outside the block. If an instance name (instance-name)
is used, then it puts all the members inside a scope within its own name space, accessed with the field
selector ( . ) operator (analogously to structures). For example,
   in Light {
       vec4 LightPos;
       vec3 LightColor;
   };
   in ColoredTexture {
       vec4 Color;
       vec2 TexCoord;
   } Material;                    // instance name
   vec3 Color;                    // different Color than Material.Color
   vec4 LightPos;                 // illegal, already defined
   ...
   ... = LightPos;                // accessing LightPos
   ... = Material.Color;          // accessing Color in ColoredTexture block

Outside the shading language (i.e., in the API), members are similarly identified except the block name is
always used in place of the instance name (API accesses are to interfaces, not to shaders). If there is no
instance name, then the API does not use the block name to access a member, just the member name.
   out Vertex {
       vec4 Position;         // API transform/feedback will use âVertex.Positionâ
       vec2 Texture;
   } Coords;                  // shader will use âCoords.Positionâ

   out Vertex2 {
       vec4 Color;            // API will use âColorâ
   };

For blocks declared as arrays, the array index must also be included when accessing members, as in this
example
   uniform Transform { // API uses âTransform[2]â to refer to instance 2
       mat4           ModelViewMatrix;
       mat4           ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
       float          Deformation;
   } transforms[4];
   ...
   ... = transforms[2].ModelViewMatrix; // shader access of instance 2
   // API uses âTransform.ModelViewMatrixâ to query an offset or other query

For uniform blocks declared as an array, each individual array element corresponds to a separate buffer
object backing one instance of the block. As the array size indicates the number of buffer objects needed,
uniform block array declarations must specify an array size. Any integral expression can be used to index
a uniform block array, as per section 4.1.9 "Arrays".




                                              41
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        When using OpenGL API entry points to identify the name of an individual block in an array of blocks,
        the name string must include an array index (e.g., Transform[2]). When using OpenGL API entry points
        to refer to offsets or other characteristics of a block member, an array index must not be specified (e.g.,
        Transform.ModelViewMatrix).
        Geometry shader input blocks must be declared as arrays and follow the array declaration and linking
        rules for all geometry shader inputs. All other input and output block arrays must specify an array size.
        There is an implementation dependent limit on the number of uniform blocks that can be used per stage.
        If this limit is exceeded, it will cause a link error.

4.3.8   Layout Qualifiers
        Layout qualifiers can appear in several forms of declaration. They can appear as part of an interface
        block definition or block member, as shown in the grammar in the previous section. They can also appear
        with just an interface qualifier to establish layouts of other declarations made with that interface qualifier:
             layout-qualifier interface-qualifier ;
        Or, they can appear with an individual variable declared with an interface qualifier:
             layout-qualifier interface-qualifier declaration ;
        Declarations of layouts can only be made at global scope, and only where indicated in the following
        subsections; their details are specific to what the interface qualifier is, and are discussed individually.
        As shown in the previous section, layout-qualifier expands to
             layout-qualifier :
                  layout ( layout-qualifier-id-list )
        The tokens in any layout-qualifier-id-list are identifiers, not keywords. Generally, they can be listed in
        any order. Order-dependent meanings exist only if explicitly called out below. Similarly, these identifiers
        are not case sensitive, unless explicitly noted otherwise.

4.3.8.1 Input Layout Qualifiers
        Tessellation control shaders do not have any input layout qualifiers.
        Vertex shaders allow input layout qualifiers on input variable declarations. The layout qualifier identifier
        for vertex shader inputs is:
             layout-qualifier-id
                  location = integer-constant
        Only one argument is accepted. For example,
           layout(location = 3) in vec4 normal;

        will establish that the vertex shader input normal is copied in from vector location number 3.




                                                         42
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



If the declared input is an array, it will be assigned consecutive locations starting with the location
specified. For example,
   layout(location = 6) in vec4 colors[3];

will establish that the vertex shader input colors is copied in from vector location numbers 6, 7, and 8.
If an input variable with no location assigned in the shader text has a location specified through the
OpenGL API, the API-assigned location will be used. Otherwise, such variables will be assigned a
location by the linker. See section 2.11.3 âVertex Attributesâ of the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification for more details. A link error will occur if an input variable is declared in multiple vertex
shaders with conflicting locations.
Tessellation evaluation shaders allow input layout qualifiers only on the interface qualifier in, not on an
input block, block member, or variable declarations. The input layout qualifier identifiers allowed for
tessellation evaluation shaders are:
     layout-qualifier-id
          triangles
          quads
          isolines
          equal_spacing
          fractional_even_spacing
          fractional_odd_spacing
          cw
          ccw
          point_mode


One subset of these identifiers, primitive mode, is used to specify a tessellation primitive mode to be used
by the tessellation primitive generator. To specify a primitive mode, the identifier must be one of
triangles, quads, or isolines, which specify that the tessellation primitive generator should subdivide a
triangle into smaller triangles, a quad into triangles, or a quad into a collection of lines, respectively.
A second subset of these identifiers, vertex spacing, is used to specify the spacing used by the tessellation
primitive generator when subdividing an edge. To specify vertex spacing, the identifier must be one of
the following.
       equal_spacing signifying that edges should be divided into a collection of equal-sized segments.
       fractional_even_spacing signifying that edges should be divided into an even number of equal-
       length segments plus two additional shorter "fractional" segments.
       fractional_odd_spacing signifying that edges should be divided into an odd number of equal-
       length segments plus two additional shorter "fractional" segments.
A third subset of these identifiers, ordering, specifies whether the tessellation primitive generator
produces triangles in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, according to the coordinate system depicted
in the OpenGL specification. The ordering identifiers cw and ccw indicate clockwise and counter-
clockwise triangles, respectively. If the tessellation primitive generator does not produce triangles,
ordering is ignored.




                                                43
                                                                              4 Variables and Types



Finally, point mode, is specified with the identifier point_mode indicating the tessellation primitive
generator should produce a point for each unique vertex in the subdivided primitive, rather than
generating lines or triangles.
Any or all of these identifiers may be specified one or more times in a single input layout declaration. If
primitive mode, vertex spacing, or ordering is declared more than once in the tessellation evaluation
shaders of a program, all such declarations must use the same identifier.
At least one tessellation evaluation shader (compilation unit) in a program must declare a primitive mode
in its input layout. Declaring vertex spacing, ordering, or point mode identifiers is optional. It is not
required that all tessellation evaluation shaders in a program declare a primitive mode. If spacing or
vertex ordering declarations are omitted, the tessellation primitive generator will use equal spacing or
counter-clockwise vertex ordering, respectively. If a point mode declaration is omitted, the tessellation
primitive generator will produce lines or triangles according to the primitive mode.
Geometry shaders allow input layout qualifiers only on the interface qualifier in, not on an input block,
block member, or variable. The layout qualifier identifiers for geometry shader inputs include primitive
identifiers and an invocation count identifier:
     layout-qualifier-id
          points
          lines
          lines_adjacency
          triangles
          triangles_adjacency
          invocations = integer-constant
The identifiers points, lines, lines_adjacency, triangles, and triangles_adjacency are used to specify the
type of input primitive accepted by the geometry shader, and only one of these is accepted. At least one
geometry shader (compilation unit) in a program must declare this input primitive layout, and all geometry
shader input layout declarations in a program must declare the same layout. It is not required that all
geometry shaders in a program declare an input primitive layout.
The identifier invocations is used to specify the number of times the geometry shader executable is
invoked for each input primitive received. Invocation count declarations are optional. If no invocation
count is declared in any geometry shader in the program, the geometry shader will be run once for each
input primitive. If an invocation count is declared, all such declarations must specify the same count. If a
shader specifies an invocation count greater than the implementation-dependent maximum, it will fail to
compile.
For example,
   layout(triangles, invocations = 6) in;

will establish that all inputs to the geometry shader are triangles and that the geometry shader executable
is run six times for each triangle processed.
All geometry shader input unsized array declarations will be sized by an earlier input primitive layout
qualifier, when present, as per the following table.




                                               44
                                                                                 4 Variables and Types



                    Layout                 Size of Input Arrays
        points                                        1
        lines                                         2
        lines_adjacency                               4
        triangles                                     3
        triangles_adjacency                           6


The intrinsically declared input array gl_in[] will also be sized by any input primitive-layout declaration.
Hence, the expression
   gl_in.length()

will return the value from the table above.
For inputs declared without an array size, including intrinsically declared inputs (i.e., gl_in), a layout must
be declared before any use of the method length() or other array use requiring its size be known.
It is a compile-time error if a layout declaration's array size (from table above) does not match any array
size specified in declarations of an input variable in the same shader. The following are all examples of
compile time errors:
   // code sequence within            one shader...
   in vec4 Color1[];    //            size unknown
   ...Color1.length()...//            illegal, length() unknown
   in vec4 Color2[2];   //            size is 2
   ...Color1.length()...//            illegal, Color1 still has no size
   in vec4 Color3[3];   //            illegal, input sizes are inconsistent
   layout(lines) in;    //            legal, input size is 2, matching
   in vec4 Color4[3];   //            illegal, contradicts layout
   ...Color1.length()...//            legal, length() is 2, Color1 sized by layout()
   layout(lines) in;    //            legal, matches other layout() declaration
   layout(triangles) in;//            illegal, does not match earlier layout() declaration

It is a link-time error if not all provided sizes (sized input arrays and layout size) match across all
geometry shaders in the program.
Fragment shaders can have an input layout only for redeclaring the built-in variable gl_FragCoord (see
section 7.1 âBuilt-In Language Variablesâ). The layout qualifier identifiers for gl_FragCoord are
     layout-qualifier-id
          origin_upper_left
          pixel_center_integer




                                                 45
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



       By default, gl_FragCoord assumes a lower-left origin for window coordinates and assumes pixel centers
       are located at half-pixel coordinates. For example, the (x, y) location (0.5, 0.5) is returned for the lower-
       left-most pixel in a window. The origin can be changed by redeclaring gl_FragCoord with the
       origin_upper_left identifier, moving the origin of gl_FragCoord to the upper left of the window, with y
       increasing in value toward the bottom of the window. The values returned can also be shifted by half a
       pixel in both x and y by pixel_center_integer so it appears the pixels are centered at whole number pixel
       offsets. This moves the (x, y) value returned by gl_FragCoord of (0.5, 0.5) by default, to (0.0, 0.0) with
       pixel_center_integer. Redeclarations are done as follows
          in vec4 gl_FragCoord;                // redeclaration that changes nothing is allowed

          // All the following are allowed redeclaration that change behavior
          layout(origin_upper_left) in vec4 gl_FragCoord;
          layout(pixel_center_integer) in vec4 gl_FragCoord;
          layout(origin_upper_left, pixel_center_integer) in vec4 gl_FragCoord;

       If gl_FragCoord is redeclared in any fragment shader in a program, it must be redeclared in all the
       fragment shaders in that program that have a static use gl_FragCoord. All redeclarations of
       gl_FragCoord in all fragment shaders in a single program must have the same set of qualifiers. Within
       any shader, the first redeclarations of gl_FragCoord must appear before any use of gl_FragCoord. The
       built-in gl_FragCoord is only predeclared in fragment shaders, so redeclaring it in any other shader
       language will be illegal.
       Redeclaring gl_FragCoord with origin_upper_left and/or pixel_center_integer qualifiers only affects
       gl_FragCoord.x and gl_FragCoord.y. It has no affect on rasterization, transformation, or any other part
       of the OpenGL pipeline or language features.

4.3.8.2 Output Layout Qualifiers
       Vertex and tessellation evaluation shaders cannot have output layout qualifiers.
       Tessellation control shaders allow output layout qualifiers only on the interface qualifier out, not on an
       output block, block member, or variable declaration. The output layout qualifier identifiers allowed for
       tessellation control shaders are:
            layout-qualifier-id
                 vertices = integer-constant
       The identifier vertices specifies the number of vertices in the output patch produced by the tessellation
       control shader, which also specifies the number of times the tessellation control shader is invoked. It is an
       error for the output vertex count to be less than or equal to zero, or greater than the implementation-
       dependent maximum patch size.
       The intrinsically declared tessellation control output array gl_out[] will also be sized by any output layout
       declaration. Hence, the expression
          gl_out.length()

       will return the output patch vertex count specified in a previous output layout qualifier. For outputs
       declared without an array size, including intrinsically declared outputs (i.e., gl_out), a layout must be
       must be declared before any use of the method length() or other array use requires its size be known.




                                                       46
                                                                               4 Variables and Types



It is a compile-time error if the output patch vertex count specified in an output layout qualifier does not
match the array size specified in any output variable declaration in the same shader.
All tessellation control shader layout declarations in a program must specify the same output patch vertex
count. There must be at least one layout qualifier specifying an output patch vertex count in any program
containing tessellation control shaders; however, such a declaration is not required in all tessellation
control shaders.
Fragment shaders allow output layout qualifiers only on the interface qualifier out. The layout qualifier
identifier for fragment shader outputs is:
     layout-qualifier-id
          location = integer-constant
          index = integer-constant
Each of these qualifiers may appear at most once. If index is specified, location must also be specified.
If index is not specified, the value 0 is used. For example,
   layout(location = 3) out vec4 color;

will establish that the fragment shader output color is copied out to fragment color 3 as the first (index
zero) input to the blend equation. And,
   layout(location = 3, index = 1) out vec4 factor;

will establish that the fragment shader output factor is copied out to fragment color 3 as the second (index
one) input to the blend equation.
If the named fragment shader output is an array, it will be assigned consecutive locations starting with the
location specified. For example,
   layout(location = 2) out vec4 colors[3];

will establish that colors is copied out to vector location numbers 2, 3, and 4.
If an output variable with no location or index assigned in the shader text has a location specified through
the OpenGL API, the API-assigned location will be used. Otherwise, such variables will be assigned a
location by the linker. All such assignments will have a color index of zero. See section 3.9.2 âShader
Executionâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification for more details. A link error will occur if an
input variable is declared in multiple vertex shaders with conflicting location or index values.
Geometry shaders can have three types of output layout identifiers: an output primitive type, a maximum
output vertex count, and per-output stream numbers. The primitive type and vertex count identifiers are
allowed only on the interface qualifier out, not on an output block, block member, or variable declaration.
The stream identifier is allowed on the interface qualifier out, on output blocks, and on variable
declarations.
The layout qualifier identifiers for geometry shader outputs are




                                                47
                                                                              4 Variables and Types



     layout-qualifier-id
          points
          line_strip
          triangle_strip
          max_vertices = integer-constant
          stream = integer-constant
The primitive type identifiers points, line_strip, and triangle_strip are used to specify the type of output
primitive produced by the geometry shader, and only one of these is accepted. At least one geometry
shader (compilation unit) in a program must declare an output primitive type, and all geometry shader
output primitive type declarations in a program must declare the same primitive type. It is not required
that all geometry shaders in a program declare an output primitive type.
The vertex count identifier max_vertices is used to specify the maximum number of vertices the shader
will ever emit in a single invocation. At least one geometry shader (compilation unit) in a program must
declare a maximum output vertex count, and all geometry shader output vertex count declarations in a
program must declare the same count. It is not required that all geometry shaders in a program declare a
count.
In this example,
   layout(triangle_strip, max_vertices               = 60) out; // order does not matter
   layout(max_vertices = 60) out;                    // redeclaration okay
   layout(triangle_strip) out;                       // redeclaration okay
   layout(points) out;                               // error, contradicts triangle_strip
   layout(max_vertices = 30) out;                    // error, contradicts 60

all outputs from the geometry shader are triangles and at most 60 vertices will be emitted by the shader. It
is an error for the maximum number of vertices to be greater than gl_MaxGeometryOutputVertices.
The identifier stream is used to specify that a geometry shader output variable or block is associated with
a particular vertex stream (numbered beginning with zero). A default stream number may be declared at
global scope by qualifying interface qualifier out as in this example:
   layout(stream = 1) out;

The stream number specified in such a declaration replaces any previous default and applies to all
subsequent block and variable declarations until a new default is established. The initial default stream
number is zero.




                                               48
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



       Each output block or non-block output variable is associated with a vertex stream. If the block or variable
       is declared with the stream identifier, it is associated with the specified stream; otherwise, it is associated
       with the current default stream. A block member may be declared with a stream identifier, but the
       specified stream must match the stream associated with the containing block. One example:
          layout(stream=1) out;                             //   default is now stream 1
          out vec4 var1;                                    //   var1 gets default stream (1)
          layout(stream=2) out Block1 {                     //   "Block1" belongs to stream 2
              layout(stream=2) vec4 var2;                   //   redundant block member stream decl
              layout(stream=3) vec2 var3;                   //   ILLEGAL (must match block stream)
              vec3 var4;                                    //   belongs to stream 2
          };
          layout(stream=0) out;                             // default is now stream 0
          out vec4 var5;                                    // var5 gets default stream (0)
          out Block2 {                                      // "Block2" gets default stream (0)
              vec4 var6;
          };
          layout(stream=3) out vec4 var7;                   // var7 belongs to stream 3

       Each vertex emitted by the geometry shader is assigned to a specific stream, and the attributes of the
       emitted vertex are taken from the set of output blocks and variables assigned to the targeted stream. After
       each vertex is emitted, the values of all output variables become undefined. Additionally, the output
       variables associated with each vertex stream may share storage. Writing to an output variable associated
       with one stream may overwrite output variables associated with any other stream. When emitting each
       vertex, a geometry shader should write to all outputs associated with the stream to which the vertex will
       be emitted and to no outputs associated with any other stream.
       If a geometry shader output block or variable is declared more than once, all such declarations must
       associate the variable with the same vertex stream. If any stream declaration specifies a non-existent
       stream number, the shader will fail to compile.
       Built-in geometry shader outputs are always associated with vertex stream zero.
       All geometry shader output layout declarations in a program must declare the same layout and same value
       for max_vertices. If geometry shaders are in a program, there must be at least one geometry output
       layout declaration somewhere in the program, but not all geometry shaders (compilation units) are
       required to declare it.

4.3.8.3 Uniform Block Layout Qualifiers
       Layout qualifiers can be used for uniform blocks, but not for non-block uniform declarations. The layout
       qualifier identifiers for uniform blocks are
            layout-qualifier-id
                 shared
                 packed
                 std140
                 row_major
                 column_major




                                                       49
                                                                                  4 Variables and Types




None of these have any semantic affect at all on the usage of the variables being declared; they only
describe how data is laid out in memory. For example, matrix semantics are always column-based, as
described in the rest of this specification, no matter what layout qualifiers are being used.
Uniform block layout qualifiers can be declared for global scope, on a single uniform block, or on a single
block member declaration.
Default layouts are established at global scope for uniform blocks as
   layout(layout-qualifier-id-list) uniform;

When this is done, the previous default qualification is first inherited and then overridden as per the
override rules listed below for each qualifier listed in the declaration. The result becomes the new default
qualification scoped to subsequent uniform block definitions.
The initial state of compilation is as if the following were declared:
   layout(shared, column_major) uniform;

Explicitly declaring this in a shader will return defaults back to their initial state.
Uniform blocks can be declared with optional layout qualifiers, and so can their individual member
declarations. Such block layout qualification is scoped only to the content of the block. As with global
layout declarations, block layout qualification first inherits from the current default qualification and then
overrides it. Similarly, individual member layout qualification is scoped just to the member declaration,
and inherits from and overrides the block's qualification.
The shared qualifier overrides only the std140 and packed qualifiers; other qualifiers are inherited. The
compiler/linker will ensure that multiple programs and programmable stages containing this definition
will share the same memory layout for this block, as long as they also matched in their row_major and/or
column_major qualifications. This allows use of the same buffer to back the same block definition across
different programs.
The packed qualifier overrides only std140 and shared; other qualifiers are inherited. When packed is
used, no shareable layout is guaranteed. The compiler and linker can optimize memory use based on what
variables actively get used and on other criteria. Offsets must be queried, as there is no other way of
guaranteeing where (and which) variables reside within the block. Attempts to share a packed uniform
block across programs or stages will generally fail. However, implementations may aid application
management of packed blocks by using canonical layouts for packed blocks.
The std140 qualifier overrides only the packed and shared qualifiers; other qualifiers are inherited. The
layout is explicitly determined by this, as described in section 2.11.4 âUniform Variablesâ under Standard
Uniform Block Layout of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification. Hence, as in shared above, the
resulting layout is shareable across programs.
Layout qualifiers on member declarations cannot use the shared, packed, or std140 qualifiers. These can
only be used at global scope or on a block declaration.
The row_major qualifier overrides only the column_major qualifier; other qualifiers are inherited. It only
affects the layout of matrices. Elements within a matrix row will be contiguous in memory.




                                                  50
                                                                                       4 Variables and Types



        The column_major qualifier overrides only the row_major qualifier; other qualifiers are inherited. It only
        affects the layout of matrices. Elements within a matrix column will be contiguous in memory.
        When multiple arguments are listed in a layout declaration, the affect will be the same as if they were
        declared one at a time, in order from left to right, each in turn inheriting from and overriding the result
        from the previous qualification.
        For example
           layout(row_major, column_major)

        results in the qualification being column_major. Other examples:
           layout(shared, row_major) uniform; // default is now shared and row_major

           layout(std140) uniform Transform {                //   layout of this block is std140
               mat4 M1;                                      //   row_major
               layout(column_major) mat4 M2;                 //   column major
               mat3 N1;                                      //   row_major
           };

           uniform T2 {        // layout of this block is shared
               ...
           };

           layout(column_major) uniform T3 {                 //   shared and column_major
               mat4 M3;                                      //   column_major
               layout(row_major) mat4 m4;                    //   row major
               mat3 N2;                                      //   column_major
           };

4.3.9   Interpolation
        The presence of and type of interpolation is controlled by the storage qualifiers centroid in, sample in,
        centroid out, and sample out, by the optional interpolation qualifiers smooth, flat, and noperspective,
        and by default behaviors established through the OpenGL API when no interpolation qualifier is present.
        When an interpolation qualifier is used, it overrides settings established through the OpenGL API. It is a
        compile-time error to use more than one interpolation qualifier.
        A variable qualified as flat will not be interpolated. Instead, it will have the same value for every
        fragment within a triangle. This value will come from a single provoking vertex, as described by the
        OpenGL Graphics System Specification. A variable may be qualified as flat centroid or flat sample,
        which will mean the same thing as qualifying it only as flat.
        A variable qualified as smooth will be interpolated in a perspective-correct manner over the primitive
        being rendered. Interpolation in a perspective correct manner is specified in equation 3.6 in the OpenGL
        Graphics System Specification, section 3.5 âLine Segmentsâ.
        A variable qualified as noperspective must be interpolated linearly in screen space, as described in
        equation 3.7 in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, section 3.5 âLine Segmentsâ.




                                                        51
                                                                                      4 Variables and Types



       When multi-sample rasterization is disabled, or for fragment shader input variables qualified with neither
       centroid in nor sample in, the value of the assigned variable may be interpolated anywhere within the
       pixel and a single value may be assigned to each sample within the pixel, to the extent permitted by the
       OpenGL Graphics System Specification.
       When multisample rasterization is enabled, centroid and sample may be used to control the location and
       frequency of the sampling of the qualified fragment shader input. If a fragment shader input is qualified
       with centroid in, a single value may be assigned to that variable for all samples in the pixel, but that value
       must be interpolated to a location that lies in both the pixel and in the primitive being rendered, including
       any of the pixel's samples covered by the primitive. Because the sample to which the variable is
       interpolated may be different in neighboring pixels, derivatives of centroid-sampled inputs may be less
       accurate than those for non-centroid interpolated variables. If a fragment shader input is qualified with
       sample in, a separate value must be assigned to that variable for each covered sample in the pixel, and
       that value must be sampled at the location of the individual sample.
       The type and presence of the interpolation qualifiers and storage qualifiers and invariant qualifiers of
       variables with the same name declared in all linked shaders must match, otherwise the link command will
       fail.

4.3.9.1 Redeclaring Built-in Interpolation Variables in the Compatibility Profile
       The following predeclared variables can be redeclared with an interpolation qualifier when using the
       compatibility profile:
       Vertex and geometry languages:
          gl_FrontColor
          gl_BackColor
          gl_FrontSecondaryColor
          gl_BackSecondaryColor

       Fragment language:
          gl_Color
          gl_SecondaryColor

       For example,
          in vec4 gl_Color;                         //   predeclared by the fragment language
          flat in vec4 gl_Color;                    //   redeclared by user to be flat
          flat in vec4 gl_FrontColor;               //   input to geometry shader, no âgl_in[]â
          flat out vec4 gl_FrontColor;              //   output from geometry shader

       Input or output instance names on blocks are not used when redeclaring built-in variables.
       If gl_Color is redeclared with an interpolation qualifier, then gl_FrontColor and gl_BackColor (if they
       are written to) must also be redeclared with the same interpolation qualifier, and vice versa. If
       gl_SecondaryColor is redeclared with an interpolation qualifier, then gl_FrontSecondaryColor and
       gl_BackSecondaryColor (if they are written to) must also be redeclared with the same interpolation
       qualifier, and vice versa. This qualifier matching on predeclared variables is only required for variables
       that are statically used within the shaders in a program.

                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



4.4     Parameter Qualifiers
        Parameters can have these qualifiers.


                 Qualifier            Meaning
                 < none: default >    same is in
                 in                   for function parameters passed into a function
                 out                  for function parameters passed back out of a function, but not initialized
                                      for use when passed in
                 inout                for function parameters passed both into and out of a function


        Parameter qualifiers are discussed in more detail in section 6.1.1 âFunction Calling Conventionsâ.

4.5     Precision and Precision Qualifiers
        Precision qualifiers are added for code portability with OpenGL ES, not for functionality. They have the
        same syntax as in OpenGL ES, as described below, but they have no semantic meaning, which includes no
        effect on the precision used to store or operate on variables.
        If an extension adds in the same semantics and functionality in the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification for
        precision qualifiers, then the extension is allowed to reuse the keywords below for that purpose.

4.5.1   Range and Precision
        Section number reserved for future use.

4.5.2   Precision Qualifiers
        Any floating point or any integer declaration can have the type preceded by one of these precision
        qualifiers:

                 Qualifier            Meaning
                 highp                None.
                 mediump              None.
                 lowp                 None.




                                                      53
                                                                                         4 Variables and Types



        For example:
           lowp float color;
           out mediump vec2 P;
           lowp ivec2 foo(lowp mat3);
           highp mat4 m;

        Literal constants do not have precision qualifiers. Neither do Boolean variables. Neither do floating point
        constructors nor integer constructors when none of the constructor arguments have precision qualifiers.
        Precision qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not effect the basic type of the variable. In particular,
        there are no constructors for precision conversions; constructors only convert types. Similarly, precision
        qualifiers, as with other qualifiers, do not contribute to function overloading based on parameter types. As
        discussed in the next chapter, function input and output is done through copies, and therefore qualifiers do
        not have to match.
        The same object declared in different shaders that are linked together must have the same precision
        qualification. This applies to inputs, outputs, uniforms, and globals.

4.5.3   Default Precision Qualifiers
        The precision statement
           precision precision-qualifier type;

        can be used to establish a default precision qualifier. The type field can be either int or float, and the
        precision-qualifier can be lowp, mediump, or highp. Any other types or qualifiers will result in an error.
        If type is float, the directive applies to non-precision-qualified floating point type (scalar, vector, and
        matrix) declarations. If type is int, the directive applies to all non-precision-qualified integer type (scalar,
        vector, signed, and unsigned) declarations. This includes global variable declarations, function return
        declarations, function parameter declarations, and local variable declarations.
        Non-precision qualified declarations will use the precision qualifier specified in the most recent precision
        statement that is still in scope. The precision statement has the same scoping rules as variable
        declarations. If it is declared inside a compound statement, its effect stops at the end of the innermost
        statement it was declared in. Precision statements in nested scopes override precision statements in outer
        scopes. Multiple precision statements for the same basic type can appear inside the same scope, with later
        statements overriding earlier statements within that scope.
        The vertex and geometry languages have the following predeclared globally scoped default precision
        statements:
           precision highp float;
           precision highp int;

        The fragment language has the following predeclared globally scoped default precision statements:
           precision mediump int;
           precision highp float;




                                                         54
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



4.5.4   Available Precision Qualifiers
        The built-in macro GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH is defined to 1:
            #define GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH 1

        This macro is available in the vertex, geometry, and fragment languages.

4.6     Variance and the Invariant Qualifier
        In this section, variance refers to the possibility of getting different values from the same expression in
        different programs. For example, say two vertex shaders, in different programs, each set gl_Position with
        the same expression in both shaders, and the input values into that expression are the same when both
        shaders run. It is possible, due to independent compilation of the two shaders, that the values assigned to
        gl_Position are not exactly the same when the two shaders run. In this example, this can cause problems
        with alignment of geometry in a multi-pass algorithm.
        In general, such variance between shaders is allowed. When such variance does not exist for a particular
        output variable, that variable is said to be invariant.

4.6.1   The Invariant Qualifier
        To ensure that a particular output variable is invariant, it is necessary to use the invariant qualifier. It can
        either be used to qualify a previously declared variable as being invariant
            invariant gl_Position;             // make existing gl_Position be invariant

            out vec3 Color;
            invariant Color;                   // make existing Color be invariant

        or as part of a declaration when a variable is declared
            invariant centroid out vec3 Color;

        The invariant qualifier must appear before any interpolation qualifiers or storage qualifiers when
        combined with a declaration. Only variables output from a shader (including those that are then input to a
        subsequent shader) can be candidates for invariance. This includes user-defined output variables and the
        built-in output variables. For variables leaving one shader and coming into another shader, the invariant
        keyword has to be used in both shaders, or a link error will result.
        Input or output instance names on blocks are not used when redeclaring built-in variables.
        The invariant keyword can be followed by a comma separated list of previously declared identifiers. All
        uses of invariant must be at the global scope, and before any use of the variables being declared as
        invariant.
        To guarantee invariance of a particular output variable across two programs, the following must also be
        true:
        â¢   The output variable is declared as invariant in both programs.
        â¢   The same values must be input to all shader input variables consumed by expressions and flow control
            contributing to the value assigned to the output variable.




                                                        55
                                                                                        4 Variables and Types



        â¢   The texture formats, texel values, and texture filtering are set the same way for any texture function
            calls contributing to the value of the output variable.
        â¢   All input values are all operated on in the same way. All operations in the consuming expressions and
            any intermediate expressions must be the same, with the same order of operands and same
            associativity, to give the same order of evaluation. Intermediate variables and functions must be
            declared as the same type with the same explicit or implicit precision qualifiers. Any control flow
            affecting the output value must be the same, and any expressions consumed to determine this control
            flow must also follow these invariance rules.
        â¢   All the data flow and control flow leading to setting the invariant output variable reside in a single
            compilation unit.
        Essentially, all the data flow and control flow leading to an invariant output must match.
        Initially, by default, all output variables are allowed to be variant. To force all output variables to be
        invariant, use the pragma
            #pragma STDGL invariant(all)

        before all declarations in a shader. If this pragma is used after the declaration of any variables or
        functions, then the set of outputs that behave as invariant is undefined. It is an error to use this pragma in
        a fragment shader.
        Generally, invariance is ensured at the cost of flexibility in optimization, so performance can be degraded
        by use of invariance. Hence, use of this pragma is intended as a debug aid, to avoid individually declaring
        all output variables as invariant.

4.6.2   Invariance of Constant Expressions
        Invariance must be guaranteed for constant expressions. A particular constant expression must evaluate to
        the same result if it appears again in the same shader or a different shader. This includes the same
        expression appearing two shaders of the same language or shaders of two different languages.
        Constant expressions must evaluate to the same result when operated on as already described above for
        invariant variables.

4.7     The Precise Qualifier
        Some algorithms require floating-point computations to exactly follow the order of operations specified in
        the source code and to treat all operations consistently, even if the implementation supports optimizations
        that could produce nearly equivalent results with higher performance. For example, many GL
        implementations support a "multiply-add" instruction that can compute a floating-point expression such as
            result = (a * b) + (c * d);




                                                        56
                                                                                4 Variables and Types



in two operations instead of three operations; one multiply and one multiply-add instead of two multiplies
and one add. The result of a floating-point multiply-add may not always be identical to first doing a
multiply yielding a floating-point result and then doing a floating-point add. Hence, in this example, the
two multiply operations would not be treated consistently; the two multiplies could effectively appear to
have differing precisions. Without any qualifiers, implementations are permitted to perform such
optimizations that effectively modify the order or number of operations used to evaluate an expression,
even if those optimizations may produce slightly different results relative to unoptimized code.
The qualifier precise will ensure that operations contributing to a variable's value are done in their stated
order and are done with operator consistency. Order is determined by operator precedence and
parenthesis, as described in section 5.1 âOperatorsâ. Operator consistency means for each particular
operator, for example the multiply operator ( * ), its operation is always computed with the same
precision. Note this effectively prevents fusing multiple operations into a single operation.
For example,
   precise out vec4 position;

declares that operations used to produce the value of position must be performed in exactly the order
specified in the source code and with all operators being treated consistently. As with the invariant
qualifier (section 4.6.1), the precise qualifier may be used to qualify a built-in or previously declared user-
defined variable as being precise:
   out vec3 Color;
   precise Color;                       // make existing Color be precise

This qualifier will affect the evaluation of an r-value in a particular function if and only if the result is
eventually consumed in the same function by an l-value qualified as precise. Any other expressions
within a function are not affected, including return values and output parameters not declared as precise
but that are eventually consumed outside the function by an variable qualified as precise.

                                                                                    4 Variables and Types



      Some examples of the use of precise:
         in vec4 a, b, c, d;
         precise out vec4 v;

         float func(float e, float f, float g, float h)
         {
             return (e*f) + (g*h);            // no constraint on order or
                                              // operator consistency
         }

         float func2(float e, float f, float g, float h)
         {
             precise float result = (e*f) + (g*h); // ensures same precision for
                                                    // the two multiplies
             return result;
         }

         float func3(float i, float j, precise out float k)
         {
             k = i * i + j;                   // precise, due to <k> declaration
         }

         void main()
         {
             vec4 r = vec3(a * b);            // precise, used to compute v.xyz
             vec4 s = vec3(c * d);            // precise, used to compute v.xyz
             v.xyz = r + s;                           // precise
             v.w = (a.w * b.w) + (c.w * d.w);         // precise
             v.x = func(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x);          // values computed in func()
                                                      // are NOT precise
             v.x = func2(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x);         // precise!
             func3(a.x * b.x, c.x * d.x, v.x);        // precise!
         }


4.8   Order of Qualification
      When multiple qualifications are present, they must follow a strict order. This order is as follows.
        precise-qualifier invariant-qualifier interpolation-qualifier storage-qualifier precision-qualifier
        storage-qualifier parameter-qualifier precision-qualifier

      There is no address-of operator nor a dereference operator. There is no typecast operator; constructors
      are used instead.

                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



5.2     Array Operations
        These are now described in section 5.7 âStructure and Array Operationsâ.

5.3     Function Calls
        If a function returns a value, then a call to that function may be used as an expression, whose type will be
        the type that was used to declare or define the function.
        Function definitions and calling conventions are discussed in section 6.1 âFunction Definitionsâ .

5.4     Constructors
        Constructors use the function call syntax, where the function name is a type, and the call makes an object
        of that type. Constructors are used the same way in both initializers and expressions. (See section 9
        âShading Language Grammarâ for details.) The parameters are used to initialize the constructed value.
        Constructors can be used to request a data type conversion to change from one scalar type to another
        scalar type, or to build larger types out of smaller types, or to reduce a larger type to a smaller type.
        In general, constructors are not built-in functions with predetermined prototypes. For arrays and
        structures, there must be exactly one argument in the constructor for each element or field. For the other
        types, the arguments must provide a sufficient number of components to perform the initialization, and it
        is an error to include so many arguments that they cannot all be used. Detailed rules follow. The
        prototypes actually listed below are merely a subset of examples.

5.4.1   Conversion and Scalar Constructors
        Converting between scalar types is done as the following prototypes indicate:
           int(uint)    //       converts     an unsigned integer to a signed integer
           int(bool)    //       converts     a Boolean value to an int
           int(float)   //       converts     a float value to an int
           int(double) //        converts     a double value to a signed integer
           uint(int)    //       converts     a signed integer value to an unsigned integer
           uint(bool)   //       converts     a Boolean value to an unsigned integer
           uint(float) //        converts     a float value to an unsigned integer
           uint(double) //       converts     a double value to an unsigned integer
           bool(int)    //       converts     a signed integer value to a Boolean
           bool(uint)   //       converts     an unsigned integer value to a Boolean value
           bool(float) //        converts     a float value to a Boolean
           bool(double) //       converts     a double value to a Boolean
           float(int)   //       converts     a signed integer value to a float
           float(uint) //        converts     an unsigned integer value to a float value
           float(bool) //        converts     a Boolean value to a float
           float(double)//       converts     a double value to a float
           double(int) //        converts     a signed integer value to a double
           double(uint) //       converts     an unsigned integer value to a double
           double(bool) //       converts     a Boolean value to a double
           double(float)//       converts     a float value to a double




                                                       60
                                                                                 5 Operators and Expressions



        When constructors are used to convert any floating-point type to an integer type, the fractional part of the
        floating-point value is dropped. It is undefined to convert a negative floating point value to an uint.
        When a constructor is used to convert any integer or floating-point type to a bool, 0 and 0.0 are converted
        to false, and non-zero values are converted to true. When a constructor is used to convert a bool to any
        integer or floating-point type, false is converted to 0 or 0.0, and true is converted to 1 or 1.0.
        The constructor int(uint) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will change the argument's
        value if its sign bit is set. The constructor uint(int) preserves the bit pattern in the argument, which will
        change its value if it is negative.
        Identity constructors, like float(float) are also legal, but of little use.
        Scalar constructors with non-scalar parameters can be used to take the first element from a non-scalar.
        For example, the constructor float(vec3) will select the first component of the vec3 parameter.

5.4.2   Vector and Matrix Constructors
        Constructors can be used to create vectors or matrices from a set of scalars, vectors, or matrices. This
        includes the ability to shorten vectors.
        If there is a single scalar parameter to a vector constructor, it is used to initialize all components of the
        constructed vector to that scalarâs value. If there is a single scalar parameter to a matrix constructor, it is
        used to initialize all the components on the matrixâs diagonal, with the remaining components initialized
        to 0.0.
        If a vector is constructed from multiple scalars, one or more vectors, or one or more matrices, or a mixture
        of these, the vector's components will be constructed in order from the components of the arguments. The
        arguments will be consumed left to right, and each argument will have all its components consumed, in
        order, before any components from the next argument are consumed. Similarly for constructing a matrix
        from multiple scalars or vectors, or a mixture of these. Matrix components will be constructed and
        consumed in column major order. In these cases, there must be enough components provided in the
        arguments to provide an initializer for every component in the constructed value. It is an error to provide
        extra arguments beyond this last used argument.
        If a matrix is constructed from a matrix, then each component (column i, row j) in the result that has a
        corresponding component (column i, row j) in the argument will be initialized from there. All other
        components will be initialized to the identity matrix. If a matrix argument is given to a matrix constructor,
        it is an error to have any other arguments.
        If the basic type (bool, int, float, or double) of a parameter to a constructor does not match the basic type
        of the object being constructed, the scalar construction rules (above) are used to convert the parameters.

                                                                        5 Operators and Expressions



Some useful vector constructors are as follows:
   vec3(float)        // initializes each component of the vec3 with the float
   vec4(ivec4)        // makes a vec4 with component-wise conversion
   vec4(mat2)         // the vec4 is column 0 followed by column 1

   vec2(float, float)                              // initializes a vec2 with 2 floats
   ivec3(int, int, int)                            // initializes an ivec3 with 3 ints
   bvec4(int, int, float, float)                   // uses 4 Boolean conversions

   vec2(vec3)                   // drops the third component of a vec3
   vec3(vec4)                   // drops the fourth component of a vec4

   vec3(vec2, float)            // vec3.x = vec2.x, vec3.y = vec2.y, vec3.z = float
   vec3(float, vec2)            // vec3.x = float, vec3.y = vec2.x, vec3.z = vec2.y
   vec4(vec3, float)
   vec4(float, vec3)
   vec4(vec2, vec2)

Some examples of these are:
   vec4 color = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
   vec4 rgba = vec4(1.0);    // sets each component to 1.0
   vec3 rgb   = vec3(color); // drop the 4th component

To initialize the diagonal of a matrix with all other elements set to zero:
   mat2(float)
   mat3(float)
   mat4(float)

That is, result[i][j] is set to the float argument for all i = j and set to 0 for all iâ  j.

        To initialize a matrix by specifying vectors or scalars, the components are assigned to the matrix elements
        in column-major order.
           mat2(vec2, vec2);                         //   one    column   per   argument
           mat3(vec3, vec3, vec3);                   //   one    column   per   argument
           mat4(vec4, vec4, vec4, vec4);             //   one    column   per   argument
           mat3x2(vec2, vec2, vec2);                 //   one    column   per   argument

           dmat2(dvec2, dvec2);
           dmat3(dvec3, dvec3, dvec3);
           dmat4(dvec4, dvec4, dvec4, dvec4);

           mat2(float, float,               // first column
                float, float);              // second column

           mat3(float, float, float,                 // first column
                float, float, float,                 // second column
                float, float, float);                // third column

           mat4(float,      float,   float,    float,       //   first column
                float,      float,   float,    float,       //   second column
                float,      float,   float,    float,       //   third column
                float,      float,   float,    float);      //   fourth column

           mat2x3(vec2, float,                // first column
                  vec2, float);               // second column

           dmat2x4(dvec3, double,             // first column
                   double, dvec3)             // second column


        A wide range of other possibilities exist, to construct a matrix from vectors and scalars, as long as enough
        components are present to initialize the matrix. To construct a matrix from a matrix:
           mat3x3(mat4x4);         // takes the upper-left 3x3 of the mat4x4
           mat2x3(mat4x2);         // takes the upper-left 2x2 of the mat4x4, last row is 0,0
           mat4x4(mat3x3);         // puts the mat3x3 in the upper-left, sets the lower right
                                   //    component to 1, and the rest to 0

5.4.3   Structure Constructors
        Once a structure is defined, and its type is given a name, a constructor is available with the same name to
        construct instances of that structure. For example:
           struct light {
               float intensity;
               vec3 position;
           };

           light lightVar = light(3.0, vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0));




                                                       63
                                                                                5 Operators and Expressions



        The arguments to the constructor will be used to set the structure's fields, in order, using one argument per
        field. Each argument must be the same type as the field it sets, or be a type that can be converted to the
        field's type according to section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversions.â
        Structure constructors can be used as initializers or in expressions.

5.4.4   Array Constructors
        Array types can also be used as constructor names, which can then be used in expressions or initializers.
        For example,

           const float c[3] = float[3](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);
           const float d[3] = float[](5.0, 7.2, 1.1);

           float g;
           ...
           float a[5] = float[5](g, 1, g, 2.3, g);
           float b[3];

           b = float[3](g, g + 1.0, g + 2.0);

        There must be exactly the same number of arguments as the size of the array being constructed. If no size
        is present in the constructor, then the array is explicitly sized to the number of arguments provided. The
        arguments are assigned in order, starting at element 0, to the elements of the constructed array. Each
        argument must be the same type as the element type of the array, or be a type that can be converted to the
        element type of the array according to section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversions.â

5.5     Vector Components
        The names of the components of a vector are denoted by a single letter. As a notational convenience,
        several letters are associated with each component based on common usage of position, color or texture
        coordinate vectors. The individual components of a vector can be selected by following the variable
        name with period ( . ) and then the component name.
        The component names supported are:

              {x, y, z, w}        Useful when accessing vectors that represent points or normals
              {r, g, b, a}              Useful when accessing vectors that represent colors
              {s, t, p, q}       Useful when accessing vectors that represent texture coordinates


        The component names x, r, and s are, for example, synonyms for the same (first) component in a vector.
        Note that the third component of the texture coordinate set, r in OpenGL, has been renamed p so as to
        avoid the confusion with r (for red) in a color.
        Accessing components beyond those declared for the vector type is an error so, for example:




                                                        64
                                                                       5 Operators and Expressions



   vec2 pos;
   pos.x // is legal
   pos.z // is illegal

The component selection syntax allows multiple components to be selected by appending their names
(from the same name set) after the period ( . ).
   vec4 v4;
   v4.rgba;       //   is   a vec4 and the same as just using v4,
   v4.rgb;        //   is   a vec3,
   v4.b;          //   is   a float,
   v4.xy;         //   is   a vec2,
   v4.xgba;       //   is   illegal - the component names do not come from
                  //                  the same set.

The order of the components can be different to swizzle them, or replicated:
   vec4 pos = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
   vec4 swiz= pos.wzyx; // swiz = (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
   vec4 dup = pos.xxyy; // dup = (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)

This notation is more concise than the constructor syntax. To form an r-value, it can be applied to any
expression that results in a vector r-value.
The component group notation can occur on the left hand side of an expression.
   vec4 pos     = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
   pos.xw =     vec2(5.0, 6.0);         // pos = (5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0)
   pos.wx =     vec2(7.0, 8.0);         // pos = (8.0, 2.0, 3.0, 7.0)
   pos.xx =     vec2(3.0, 4.0);         // illegal - 'x' used twice
   pos.xy =     vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);    // illegal - mismatch between vec2 and vec3

To form an l-value, swizzling must be applied to an l-value of vector type, contain no duplicate
components, and it results in an l-value of scalar or vector type, depending on number of components
specified.
Array subscripting syntax can also be applied to vectors to provide numeric indexing. So in
   vec4       pos;

pos[2] refers to the third element of pos and is equivalent to pos.z. This allows variable indexing into a
vector, as well as a generic way of accessing components. Any integer expression can be used as the
subscript. The first component is at index zero. Reading from or writing to a vector using a constant
integral expression with a value that is negative or greater than or equal to the size of the vector is illegal.
When indexing with non-constant expressions, behavior is undefined if the index is negative, or greater
than or equal to the size of the vector.




                                                 65
                                                                           5 Operators and Expressions



5.6   Matrix Components
      The components of a matrix can be accessed using array subscripting syntax. Applying a single subscript
      to a matrix treats the matrix as an array of column vectors, and selects a single column, whose type is a
      vector of the same size as the matrix. The leftmost column is column 0. A second subscript would then
      operate on the resulting vector, as defined earlier for vectors. Hence, two subscripts select a column and
      then a row.
         mat4 m;
         m[1] = vec4(2.0);                    // sets the second column to all 2.0
         m[0][0] = 1.0;                       // sets the upper left element to 1.0
         m[2][3] = 2.0;                       // sets the 4th element of the third column to 2.0

      Behavior is undefined when accessing a component outside the bounds of a matrix with a non-constant
      expression. It is an error to access a matrix with a constant expression that is outside the bounds of the
      matrix.

5.7   Structure and Array Operations
      The fields of a structure and the length method of an array are selected using the period ( . ).
      In total, only the following operators are allowed to operate on arrays and structures as whole entities:

           field or method selector       .
           equality                       == !=
           assignment                     =
           indexing (arrays only)         []


      The equality operators and assignment operator are only allowed if the two operands are same size and
      type. Structure types must be of the same declared structure. Both array operands must be explicitly
      sized. When using the equality operators, two structures are equal if and only if all the fields are
      component-wise equal, and two arrays are equal if and only if all the elements are element-wise equal.
      Array elements are accessed using the array subscript operator ( [ ] ). An example of accessing an array
      element is
         diffuseColor += lightIntensity[3] * NdotL;

      Array indices start at zero. Array elements are accessed using an expression whose type is int or uint.
      Behavior is undefined if a shader subscripts an array with an index less than 0 or greater than or equal to
      the size the array was declared with.




                                                      66
                                                                              5 Operators and Expressions



      Arrays can also be accessed with the method operator ( . ) and the length method to query the size of the
      array:
          lightIntensity.length()                // return the size of the array



5.8   Assignments
      Assignments of values to variable names are done with the assignment operator ( = ):
          lvalue-expression = rvalue-expression

      The lvalue-expression evaluates to an l-value. The assignment operator stores the value of rvalue-
      expression into the l-value and returns an r-value with the type and precision of lvalue-expression. The
      lvalue-expression and rvalue-expression must have the same type, or the expression must have a type in
      the table in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that converts to the type of lvalue-expression, in which
      case an implicit conversion will be done on the rvalue-expression before the assignment is done. Any
      other desired type-conversions must be specified explicitly via a constructor. L-values must be writable.
      Variables that are built-in types, entire structures or arrays, structure fields, l-values with the field selector
      ( . ) applied to select components or swizzles without repeated fields, l-values within parentheses, and l-
      values dereferenced with the array subscript operator ( [ ] ) are all l-values. Other binary or unary
      expressions, function names, swizzles with repeated fields, and constants cannot be l-values. The ternary
      operator (?:) is also not allowed as an l-value.
      Expressions on the left of an assignment are evaluated before expressions on the right of the assignment.
      The other assignment operators are
      â¢   add into (+=)
      â¢   subtract from (-=)
      â¢   multiply into (*=)
      â¢   divide into (/=)
      â¢   modulus into (%=)
      â¢   left shift by (<<=)
      â¢   right shift by (>>=)
      â¢   and into (&=)
      â¢   inclusive-or into (|=)
      â¢   exclusive-or into (^=)




                                                        67
                                                                             5 Operators and Expressions



      where the general expression

              lvalue op= expression

      is equivalent to

              lvalue = lvalue op expression

      where op is as described below, and the l-value and expression must satisfy the semantic requirements of
      both op and equals (=).
      Reading a variable before writing (or initializing) it is legal, however the value is undefined.

5.9   Expressions
      Expressions in the shading language are built from the following:
      â¢   Constants of type bool, all integer types, all floating-point types, all vector types, and all matrix types.
      â¢   Constructors of all types.
      â¢   Variable names of all types.
      â¢   An array name with the length method applied.
      â¢   Subscripted array names.
      â¢   Function calls that return values.
      â¢   Component field selectors and array subscript results.
      â¢   Parenthesized expression. Any expression can be parenthesized. Parentheses can be used to group
          operations. Operations within parentheses are done before operations across parentheses.
      â¢   The arithmetic binary operators add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) operate on integer and
          floating-point scalars, vectors, and matrices. If the fundamental types in the operands do not match,
          then the conversions from section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ are applied to create matching types.
          All arithmetic binary operators result in the same fundamental type (signed integer, unsigned integer,
          single-precision floating point, or double-precision floating point) as the operands they operate on,
          after operand type conversion. After conversion, the following cases are valid
          â¢    The two operands are scalars. In this case the operation is applied, resulting in a scalar.
          â¢    One operand is a scalar, and the other is a vector or matrix. In this case, the scalar operation is
               applied independently to each component of the vector or matrix, resulting in the same size vector
               or matrix.
          â¢    The two operands are vectors of the same size. In this case, the operation is done component-wise
               resulting in the same size vector.
          â¢    The operator is add (+), subtract (-), or divide (/), and the operands are matrices with the same
               number of rows and the same number of columns. In this case, the operation is done component-
               wise resulting in the same size matrix.




                                                       68
                                                                      5 Operators and Expressions



    â¢   The operator is multiply (*), where both operands are matrices or one operand is a vector and the
        other a matrix. A right vector operand is treated as a column vector and a left vector operand as a
        row vector. In all these cases, it is required that the number of columns of the left operand is equal
        to the number of rows of the right operand. Then, the multiply (*) operation does a linear
        algebraic multiply, yielding an object that has the same number of rows as the left operand and the
        same number of columns as the right operand. Section 5.10 âVector and Matrix Operationsâ
        explains in more detail how vectors and matrices are operated on.
    All other cases are illegal.
    Dividing by zero does not cause an exception but does result in an unspecified value. Use the built-in
    functions dot, cross, matrixCompMult, and outerProduct, to get, respectively, vector dot product,
    vector cross product, matrix component-wise multiplication, and the matrix product of a column
    vector times a row vector.
â¢   The operator modulus (%) operates on signed or unsigned integer scalars or integer vectors. If the
    fundamental types in the operands do not match, then the conversions from section 4.1.10 âImplicit
    Conversionsâ are applied to create matching types. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size.
    If one operand is a scalar and the other vector, then the scalar is applied component-wise to the vector,
    resulting in the same type as the vector. If both are vectors of the same size, the result is computed
    component-wise. The resulting value is undefined for any component computed with a second
    operand that is zero, while results for other components with non-zero second operands remain
    defined. If both operands are non-negative, then the remainder is non-negative. Results are undefined
    if one or both operands are negative. The operator modulus (%) is not defined for any other data
    types (non-integer types).
â¢   The arithmetic unary operators negate (-), post- and pre-increment and decrement (-- and ++) operate
    on integer or floating-point values (including vectors and matrices). All unary operators work
    component-wise on their operands. These result with the same type they operated on. For post- and
    pre-increment and decrement, the expression must be one that could be assigned to (an l-value). Pre-
    increment and pre-decrement add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents of the expression they operate on,
    and the value of the pre-increment or pre-decrement expression is the resulting value of that
    modification. Post-increment and post-decrement expressions add or subtract 1 or 1.0 to the contents
    of the expression they operate on, but the resulting expression has the expressionâs value before the
    post-increment or post-decrement was executed.
â¢   The relational operators greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal (>=), and less than or
    equal (<=) operate only on scalar integer and scalar floating-point expressions. The result is scalar
    Boolean. Either the operandsâ types must match, or the conversions from section 4.1.10 âImplicit
    Conversionsâ will be applied to obtain matching types. To do component-wise relational comparisons
    on vectors, use the built-in functions lessThan, lessThanEqual, greaterThan, and
    greaterThanEqual.
â¢   The equality operators equal (==), and not equal (!=) operate on all types. They result in a scalar
    Boolean. If the operand types do not match, then there must be a conversion from section 4.1.10
    âImplicit Conversionsâ applied to one operand that can make them match, in which case this
    conversion is done. For vectors, matrices, structures, and arrays, all components, fields, or elements of
    one operand must equal the corresponding components, fields, or elements in the other operand for the
    operands to be considered equal. To get a vector of component-wise equality results for vectors, use
    the built-in functions equal and notEqual.




                                                69
                                                                        5 Operators and Expressions



â¢   The logical binary operators and (&&), or ( | | ), and exclusive or (^^) operate only on two Boolean
    expressions and result in a Boolean expression. And (&&) will only evaluate the right hand operand
    if the left hand operand evaluated to true. Or ( | | ) will only evaluate the right hand operand if the left
    hand operand evaluated to false. Exclusive or (^^) will always evaluate both operands.
â¢   The logical unary operator not (!). It operates only on a Boolean expression and results in a Boolean
    expression. To operate on a vector, use the built-in function not.
â¢   The sequence ( , ) operator that operates on expressions by returning the type and value of the right-
    most expression in a comma separated list of expressions. All expressions are evaluated, in order,
    from left to right.
â¢   The ternary selection operator (?:). It operates on three expressions (exp1 ? exp2 : exp3). This
    operator evaluates the first expression, which must result in a scalar Boolean. If the result is true, it
    selects to evaluate the second expression, otherwise it selects to evaluate the third expression. Only
    one of the second and third expressions is evaluated. The second and third expressions can be any
    type, as long their types match, or there is a conversion in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ that
    can be applied to one of the expressions to make their types match. This resulting matching type is the
    type of the entire expression.
â¢   The one's complement operator (~). The operand must be of type signed or unsigned integer or integer
    vector, and the result is the one's complement of its operand; each bit of each component is
    complemented, including any sign bits.
â¢   The shift operators (<<) and (>>). For both operators, the operands must be signed or unsigned
    integers or integer vectors. One operand can be signed while the other is unsigned. In all cases, the
    resulting type will be the same type as the left operand. If the first operand is a scalar, the second
    operand has to be a scalar as well. If the first operand is a vector, the second operand must be a scalar
    or a vector, and the result is computed component-wise. The result is undefined if the right operand is
    negative, or greater than or equal to the number of bits in the left expression's base type. The value of
    E1 << E2 is E1 (interpreted as a bit pattern) left-shifted by E2 bits. The value of E1 >> E2 is E1 right-
    shifted by E2 bit positions. If E1 is a signed integer, the right-shift will extend the sign bit. If E1 is an
    unsigned integer, the right-shift will zero-extend.
â¢   The bitwise operators and (&), exclusive-or (^), and inclusive-or (|). The operands must be of type
    signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors. The operands cannot be vectors of differing size. If one
    operand is a scalar and the other a vector, the scalar is applied component-wise to the vector, resulting
    in the same type as the vector. The fundamental types of the operands (signed or unsigned) must
    match, and will be the resulting fundamental type. For and (&), the result is the bitwise-and function
    of the operands. For exclusive-or (^), the result is the bitwise exclusive-or function of the operands.
    For inclusive-or (|), the result is the bitwise inclusive-or function of the operands.
For a complete specification of the syntax of expressions, see section 9 âShading Language Grammar.â

5.10   Vector and Matrix Operations
       With a few exceptions, operations are component-wise. Usually, when an operator operates on a vector or
       matrix, it is operating independently on each component of the vector or matrix, in a component-wise
       fashion. For example,
          vec3 v, u;
          float f;

          v = u + f;

       will be equivalent to
          v.x = u.x + f;
          v.y = u.y + f;
          v.z = u.z + f;

       And
          vec3 v, u, w;
          w = v + u;

       will be equivalent to
          w.x = v.x + u.x;
          w.y = v.y + u.y;
          w.z = v.z + u.z;

       and likewise for most operators and all integer and floating point vector and matrix types. The exceptions
       are matrix multiplied by vector, vector multiplied by matrix, and matrix multiplied by matrix. These do
       not operate component-wise, but rather perform the correct linear algebraic multiply.
          vec3 v, u;
          mat3 m;

          u = v * m;

       is equivalent to
          u.x = dot(v, m[0]); // m[0] is the left column of m
          u.y = dot(v, m[1]); // dot(a,b) is the inner (dot) product of a and b
          u.z = dot(v, m[2]);

       And
          u = m * v;

       is equivalent to
          u.x = m[0].x * v.x         +   m[1].x * v.y       +   m[2].x * v.z;
          u.y = m[0].y * v.x         +   m[1].y * v.y       +   m[2].y * v.z;
          u.z = m[0].z * v.x         +   m[1].z * v.y       +   m[2].z * v.z;

And
   mat3 m, n, r;

   r = m * n;

is equivalent to
   r[0].x = m[0].x * n[0].x             +   m[1].x * n[0].y   +    m[2].x * n[0].z;
   r[1].x = m[0].x * n[1].x             +   m[1].x * n[1].y   +    m[2].x * n[1].z;
   r[2].x = m[0].x * n[2].x             +   m[1].x * n[2].y   +    m[2].x * n[2].z;

   r[0].y = m[0].y * n[0].x             +   m[1].y * n[0].y   +    m[2].y * n[0].z;
   r[1].y = m[0].y * n[1].x             +   m[1].y * n[1].y   +    m[2].y * n[1].z;
   r[2].y = m[0].y * n[2].x             +   m[1].y * n[2].y   +    m[2].y * n[2].z;

   r[0].z = m[0].z * n[0].x             +   m[1].z * n[0].y   +    m[2].z * n[0].z;
   r[1].z = m[0].z * n[1].x             +   m[1].z * n[1].y   +    m[2].z * n[1].z;
   r[2].z = m[0].z * n[2].x             +   m[1].z * n[2].y   +    m[2].z * n[2].z;

and similarly for other sizes of vectors and matrices.

6 Statements and Structure

   The fundamental building blocks of the OpenGL Shading Language are:
   â¢   statements and declarations
   â¢   function definitions
   â¢   selection (if-else and switch-case-default)
   â¢   iteration (for, while, and do-while)
   â¢   jumps (discard, return, break, and continue)


   The overall structure of a shader is as follows

        translation-unit:
             global-declaration
             translation-unit global-declaration
        global-declaration:
            function-definition
            declaration
   That is, a shader is a sequence of declarations and function bodies. Function bodies are defined as

        function-definition:
             function-prototype { statement-list }
        statement-list:
             statement
             statement-list statement
        statement:
             compound-statement
             simple-statement
   Curly braces are used to group sequences of statements into compound statements.

        compound-statement:
            { statement-list }
        simple-statement:
            declaration-statement
            expression-statement
            selection-statement




                                                     73
                                                                             6 Statements and Structure



                iteration-statement
                jump-statement


      Simple declaration, expression, and jump statements end in a semi-colon.
      This above is slightly simplified, and the complete grammar specified in section 9 âShading Language
      Grammarâ should be used as the definitive specification.
      Declarations and expressions have already been discussed.

6.1   Function Definitions
      As indicated by the grammar above, a valid shader is a sequence of global declarations and function
      definitions. A function is declared as the following example shows:
         // prototype
         returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn);

      and a function is defined like
         // definition
         returnType functionName (type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
         {
             // do some computation
             return returnValue;
         }

      where returnType must be present and include a type. Each of the typeN must include a type and can
      optionally include a parameter qualifier and/or const. The formal argument names (args above) in the
      declarations are optional for both the declaration and definition forms.
      A function is called by using its name followed by a list of arguments in parentheses.
      Arrays are allowed as arguments and as the return type. In both cases, the array must be explicitly sized.
      An array is passed or returned by using just its name, without brackets, and the size of the array must
      match the size specified in the function's declaration.
      Structures are also allowed as argument types. The return type can also be structure.
      See section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive reference on the syntax to declare and
      define functions.
      All functions must be either declared with a prototype or defined with a body before they are called. For
      example:
         float myfunc (float f,                    // f is an input parameter
                       out float g);               // g is an output parameter


      Functions that return no value must be declared as void. Functions that accept no input arguments need
      not use void in the argument list because prototypes (or definitions) are required and therefore there is no
      ambiguity when an empty argument list "( )" is declared. The idiom â(void)â as a parameter list is
      provided for convenience.




                                                     74
                                                                       6 Statements and Structure



Function names can be overloaded. The same function name can be used for multiple functions, as long
as the parameter types differ. If a function name is declared twice with the same parameter types, then the
return types and all qualifiers must also match, and it is the same function being declared. For example,
    vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y);                  // (A)
    vec4 f(in vec4 x, out uvec4 y);                 // (B) okay, different argument type
    vec4 f(in ivec4 x, out uvec4 y);                // (C) okay, different argument type

    int f(in vec4 x, out ivec4 y);                      // error, only return type differs
    vec4 f(in vec4 x, in vec4 y);                       // error, only qualifier differs
    vec4 f(const in vec4 x, out vec4 y);                // error, only qualifier differs

When function calls are resolved, an exact type match for all the arguments is sought. If an exact match is
found, all other functions are ignored, and the exact match is used. If no exact match is found, then the
implicit conversions in section 4.1.10 âImplicit Conversionsâ will be applied to find a match.
Mismatched types on input parameters (in or inout or default) must have a conversion from the calling
argument type to the formal parameter type. Mismatched types on output parameters (out or inout) must
have a conversion from the formal parameter type to the calling argument type.
If implicit conversions can be used to find more than one matching function, a single best-matching
function is sought. To determine a best match, the conversions between calling argument and formal
parameter types are compared for each function argument and pair of matching functions. After these
comparisons are performed, each pair of matching functions are compared. A function declaration A is
considered a better match than function declaration B if
â¢   for at least one function argument, the conversion for that argument in A is better than the
    corresponding conversion in B; and
â¢   there is no function argument for which the conversion in B is better than the corresponding
    conversion in A.
If a single function declaration is considered a better match than every other matching function
declaration, it will be used. Otherwise, a semantic error for an ambiguous overloaded function call occurs
and the shader will fail to compile.
To determine whether the conversion for a single argument in one match is better than that for another
match, the following rules are applied, in order:
    1.   An exact match is better than a match involving any implicit conversion.
    2.   A match involving an implicit conversion from float to double is better than a match involving
         any other implicit conversion.
    3.   A match involving an implicit conversion from either int or uint to float is better than a match
         involving an implicit conversion from either int or uint to double.
If none of the rules above apply to a particular pair of conversions, neither conversion is considered better
than the other.
For the example function prototypes (A), (B), and (C) above, the following examples show how the rules
apply to different sets of calling argument types:




                                               75
                                                                                   6 Statements and Structure



            f(vec4, vec4);                  //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y)
            f(vec4, uvec4);                 //   exact match of vec4 f(in vec4 x, out ivec4 y)
            f(vec4, ivec4);                 //   matched to vec4 f(in vec4 x, out vec4 y)
                                            //     (C) not relevant, can't convert vec4 to
                                            //     ivec4. (A) better than (B) for 2nd
                                            //     argument (rule 2), same on first argument.
            f(ivec4, vec4);                 //   NOT matched. All three match by implicit
                                            //     conversion. (C) is better than (A) and (B)
                                            //     on the first argument. (A) is better than
                                            //     (B) and (C).

        User-defined functions can have multiple declarations, but only one definition. A shader can redefine
        built-in functions. If a built-in function is redeclared in a shader (i.e., a prototype is visible) before a call
        to it, then the linker will only attempt to resolve that call within the set of shaders that are linked with it.
        The function main is used as the entry point to a shader executable. A shader need not contain a function
        named main, but one shader in a set of shaders linked together to form a single shader executable must.
        This function takes no arguments, returns no value, and must be declared as type void:
            void main()
            {
                ...
            }

        The function main can contain uses of return. See section 6.4 âJumpsâ for more details.
        It is an error to declare or define a function main with any other parameters or return type.

6.1.1   Function Calling Conventions
        Functions are called by value-return. This means input arguments are copied into the function at call time,
        and output arguments are copied back to the caller before function exit. Because the function works with
        local copies of parameters, there are no issues regarding aliasing of variables within a function. To
        control what parameters are copied in and/or out through a function definition or declaration:
        â¢   The keyword in is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied in, but not copied out.
        â¢   The keyword out is used as a qualifier to denote a parameter is to be copied out, but not copied in.
            This should be used whenever possible to avoid unnecessarily copying parameters in.
        â¢   The keyword inout is used as a qualifier to denote the parameter is to be both copied in and copied
            out.
        â¢   A function parameter declared with no such qualifier means the same thing as specifying in.
        All arguments are evaluated at call time, exactly once, in order, from left to right. Evaluation of an in
        parameter results in a value that is copied to the formal parameter. Evaluation of an out parameter results
        in an l-value that is used to copy out a value when the function returns. Evaluation of an inout parameter
        results in both a value and an l-value; the value is copied to the formal parameter at call time and the l-
        value is used to copy out a value when the function returns.
        The order in which output parameters are copied back to the caller is undefined.




                                                          76
                                                                         6 Statements and Structure



If the function matching described in the previous section required argument type conversions, these
conversions are applied at copy-in and copy-out times.
In a function, writing to an input-only parameter is allowed. Only the functionâs copy is modified. This
can be prevented by declaring a parameter with the const qualifier.
When calling a function, expressions that do not evaluate to l-values cannot be passed to parameters
declared as out or inout.
No qualifier is allowed on the return type of a function.

     function-prototype :
          precision-qualifier type function-name(const-qualifier parameter-qualifier precision-qualifier
          type name array-specifier, ... )
     type :
          any basic type, array type, structure name, or structure definition
     const-qualifier :
          empty
          const
     parameter-qualifier :
         empty
         in
         out
         inout
     name :
         empty
         identifier
     array-specifier :
          empty
          [ integral-constant-expression ]


However, the const qualifier cannot be used with out or inout. The above is used for function
declarations (i.e., prototypes) and for function definitions. Hence, function definitions can have unnamed
arguments.
Recursion is not allowed, not even statically. Static recursion is present if the static function-call graph of
the program contains cycles. This includes all potential function calls through variables declared as
subroutine uniform (described below).




                                                77
                                                                                6 Statements and Structure



6.1.2   Subroutines
        Subroutines provide a mechanism allowing shaders to be compiled in a manner where the target of one or
        more function calls can be changed at run-time without requiring any shader recompilation. For example,
        a single shader may be compiled with support for multiple illumination algorithms to handle different
        kinds of lights or surface materials. An application using such a shader may switch illumination
        algorithms by changing the value of its subroutine uniforms. To use subroutines, a subroutine type is
        declared, one or more functions are associated with that subroutine type, and a subroutine variable of that
        type is declared. The function currently assigned to the variable function is then called by using function
        calling syntax replacing a function name with the name of the subroutine variable. Subroutine variables
        are uniforms, and are assigned to specific functions only through commands (UniformSubroutinesuiv) in
        the OpenGL API.
        Subroutine types are declared using a statement similar to a function declaration, with the subroutine
        keyword, as follows:
           subroutine returnType subroutineTypeName(type0 arg0, type1 arg1,
                                                    ..., typen argn);

        As with function declarations, the formal argument names (args above) are optional. Functions are
        associated with subroutine types of matching declarations by defining the function with the subroutine
        keyword and a list of subroutine types the function matches:
           subroutine(subroutineTypeName0, ..., subroutineTypeNameN)
           returnType functionName(type0 arg0, type1 arg1, ..., typen argn)
           { ... } // function body

        It is an error if arguments and return type don't match between the function and each associated subroutine
        type.
        Functions declared with subroutine must include a body. An overloaded function cannot be declared
        with subroutine; a program will fail to compile or link if any shader or stage contains two or more
        functions with the same name if the name is associated with a subroutine type.
        Subroutine type variables are required to be subroutine uniforms, and are declared with a specific
        subroutine type in a subroutine uniform variable declaration:
           subroutine uniform subroutineTypeName subroutineVarName;

        Subroutine uniform variables are called the same way functions are called. When a subroutine variable
        (or an element of a subroutine variable array) is associated with a particular function, all function calls
        through that variable will call that particular function.
        Unlike other uniform variables, subroutine uniform variables are scoped to the shader execution stage the
        variable is declared in.
        Subroutine variables may be declared as explicitly-sized arrays, which can be dynamically indexed at use.

                                                                               6 Statements and Structure



6.2   Selection
      Conditional control flow in the shading language is done by either if, if-else, or switch statements:
           selection-statement :
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement
                 if ( bool-expression ) statement else statement
                 switch ( init-expression ) { switch-statement-listopt }
      Where switch-statement-list is a list of zero or more switch-statement and other statements defined by the
      language, where switch-statement adds some forms of labels. That is
           switch-statement-list :
                switch-statement
                switch-statement-list switch-statement
           switch-statement :
                case constant-expression :
                default :
                statement

      If an if-expression evaluates to true, then the first statement is executed. If it evaluates to false and there
      is an else part then the second statement is executed.
      Any expression whose type evaluates to a Boolean can be used as the conditional expression bool-
      expression. Vector types are not accepted as the expression to if.
      Conditionals can be nested.
      The type of init-expression in a switch statement must be a scalar integer. If a case label has a constant-
      expression of equal value, then execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, if there is a default
      label, execution will continue after that label. Otherwise, execution skips the rest of the switch statement.
      It is an error to have more than one default or a replicated constant-expression. A break statement not
      nested in a loop or other switch statement (either not nested or nested only in if or if-else statements) will
      also skip the rest of the switch statement. Fall through labels are allowed, but it is an error to have no
      statement between a label and the end of the switch statement. No statements are allowed in a switch
      statement before the first case statement.
      No case or default labels can be nested inside other flow control nested within their corresponding
      switch.




                                                       79
                                                                             6 Statements and Structure



6.3   Iteration
      For, while, and do loops are allowed as follows:
         for (init-expression; condition-expression; loop-expression)
             sub-statement

         while (condition-expression)
             sub-statement

         do
             statement
         while (condition-expression)

      See section 9 âShading Language Grammarâ for the definitive specification of loops.
      The for loop first evaluates the init-expression, then the condition-expression. If the condition-
      expression evaluates to true, then the body of the loop is executed. After the body is executed, a for loop
      will then evaluate the loop-expression, and then loop back to evaluate the condition-expression, repeating
      until the condition-expression evaluates to false. The loop is then exited, skipping its body and skipping
      its loop-expression. Variables modified by the loop-expression maintain their value after the loop is
      exited, provided they are still in scope. Variables declared in init-expression or condition-expression are
      only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the for loop.
      The while loop first evaluates the condition-expression. If true, then the body is executed. This is then
      repeated, until the condition-expression evaluates to false, exiting the loop and skipping its body.
      Variables declared in the condition-expression are only in scope until the end of the sub-statement of the
      while loop.
      The do-while loop first executes the body, then executes the condition-expression. This is repeated until
      condition-expression evaluates to false, and then the loop is exited.
      Expressions for condition-expression must evaluate to a Boolean.
      Both the condition-expression and the init-expression can declare and initialize a variable, except in the
      do-while loop, which cannot declare a variable in its condition-expression. The variableâs scope lasts
      only until the end of the sub-statement that forms the body of the loop.
      Loops can be nested.
      Non-terminating loops are allowed. The consequences of very long or non-terminating loops are platform
      dependent.




                                                     80
                                                                            6 Statements and Structure



6.4   Jumps
      These are the jumps:

           jump_statement:
               continue;
               break;
               return;
               return expression;
               discard;    // in the fragment shader language only


      There is no âgotoâ nor other non-structured flow of control.
      The continue jump is used only in loops. It skips the remainder of the body of the inner most loop of
      which it is inside. For while and do-while loops, this jump is to the next evaluation of the loop
      condition-expression from which the loop continues as previously defined. For for loops, the jump is to
      the loop-expression, followed by the condition-expression.
      The break jump can also be used only in loops and switch statements. It is simply an immediate exit of
      the inner-most loop or switch statements containing the break. No further execution of condition-
      expression, loop-expression, or switch-statement is done.
      The discard keyword is only allowed within fragment shaders. It can be used within a fragment shader to
      abandon the operation on the current fragment. This keyword causes the fragment to be discarded and no
      updates to any buffers will occur. Control flow exits the shader, and subsequent implicit or explicit
      derivatives are undefined when this exit is non-uniform. It would typically be used within a conditional
      statement, for example:
         if (intensity < 0.0)
             discard;

      A fragment shader may test a fragmentâs alpha value and discard the fragment based on that test.
      However, it should be noted that coverage testing occurs after the fragment shader runs, and the coverage
      test can change the alpha value.
      The return jump causes immediate exit of the current function. If it has expression then that is the return
      value for the function.
      The function main can use return. This simply causes main to exit in the same way as when the end of
      the function had been reached. It does not imply a use of discard in a fragment shader. Using return in
      main before defining outputs will have the same behavior as reaching the end of main before defining
      outputs.

7 Built-in Variables

7.1   Built-In Language Variables
      Some OpenGL operations occur in fixed functionality and need to provide values to or receive values
      from shader executables. Shaders communicate with fixed-function OpenGL pipeline stages, and
      optionally with other shader executables, through the use of built-in input and output variables.
      In the vertex language, the built-ins are intrinsically declared as:
         in    int      gl_VertexID;
         in    int      gl_InstanceID;

         out gl_PerVertex {
             vec4 gl_Position;
             float gl_PointSize;
             float gl_ClipDistance[];
         };

      In the geometry language, the built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
         in gl_PerVertex {
             vec4 gl_Position;
             float gl_PointSize;
             float gl_ClipDistance[];
         } gl_in[];

         in int gl_PrimitiveIDIn;
         in int gl_InvocationID;

         out gl_PerVertex {
             vec4 gl_Position;
             float gl_PointSize;
             float gl_ClipDistance[];
         };

         out int gl_PrimitiveID;
         out int gl_Layer;

In the tessellation control language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_in[gl_MaxPatchVertices];

       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_out[];

   patch out float gl_TessLevelOuter[4];
   patch out float gl_TessLevelInner[2];

In the tessellation evaluation language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   } gl_in[gl_MaxPatchVertices];

   in int gl_PatchVerticesIn;
   in int gl_PrimitiveID;
   in vec3 gl_TessCoord;
   patch in float gl_TessLevelOuter[4];
   patch in float gl_TessLevelInner[2];

   out gl_PerVertex {
       vec4 gl_Position;
       float gl_PointSize;
       float gl_ClipDistance[];
   };




                                                 83
                                                                                    7 Built-in Variables



In the fragment language, built-in variables are intrinsically declared as:
   in    vec4    gl_FragCoord;
   in    bool    gl_FrontFacing;
   in    float   gl_ClipDistance[];
   in    vec2    gl_PointCoord;
   in    int     gl_PrimitiveID;
   in    int     gl_SampleID;
   in    vec2    gl_SamplePosition;

   out   vec4    gl_FragColor;                                  // deprecated
   out   vec4    gl_FragData[gl_MaxDrawBuffers];                // deprecated
   out   float   gl_FragDepth;
   out   int     gl_SampleMask[];

Each of the above variables is discussed below.
The variable gl_VertexID is a vertex language input variable that holds an integer index for the vertex, as
defined under âShader Inputsâ in section 2.11.7 âVarying Variablesâ in the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification. While the variable gl_VertexID is always present, its value is not always defined.
The variable gl_InstanceID is a vertex language input variable that holds the integer index of the current
primitive in an instanced draw call (see âShader Inputsâ in section 2.11.7 âVarying Variablesâ in the
OpenGL Graphics System Specification). If the current primitive does not come from an instanced draw
call, the value of gl_InstanceID is zero.
As an output variable, gl_Position is intended for writing the homogeneous vertex position. It can be
written at any time during shader execution. This value will be used by primitive assembly, clipping,
culling, and other fixed functionality operations, if present, that operate on primitives after vertex
processing has occurred. Its value is undefined after the vertex processing stage if the vertex shader
executable does not write gl_Position, and it is undefined after geometry processing if the geometry
executable calls EmitVertex() without having written gl_Position since the last EmitVertex() (or hasn't
written it at all). As an input variable, gl_Position reads the output written in the previous shader stage to
gl_Position.
As an output variable, gl_PointSize is intended for a shader to write the size of the point to be rasterized.
It is measured in pixels. If gl_PointSize is not written to, its value is undefined in subsequent pipe stages.
As an input variable, gl_PointSize reads the output written in the previous shader stage to gl_Position.
The variable gl_ClipDistance provides the forward compatible mechanism for controlling user clipping.
The element gl_ClipDistance[i] specifies a clip distance for each plane i. A distance of 0 means the
vertex is on the plane, a positive distance means the vertex is inside the clip plane, and a negative distance
means the point is outside the clip plane. The clip distances will be linearly interpolated across the
primitive and the portion of the primitive with interpolated distances less than 0 will be clipped.




                                                84
                                                                                  7 Built-in Variables



The gl_ClipDistance array is predeclared as unsized and must be sized by the shader either redeclaring it
with a size or indexing it only with integral constant expressions. This needs to size the array to include
all the clip planes that are enabled via the OpenGL API; if the size does not include all enabled planes,
results are undefined. The size can be at most gl_MaxClipDistances. The number of varying components
(see gl_MaxVaryingComponents) consumed by gl_ClipDistance will match the size of the array, no
matter how many planes are enabled. The shader must also set all values in gl_ClipDistance that have
been enabled via the OpenGL API, or results are undefined. Values written into gl_ClipDistance for
planes that are not enabled have no effect.
As an output variable, gl_ClipDistance provides the place for the shader to write these distances. As an
input in all but the fragment language, it reads the values written in the previous shader stage. In the
fragment language, gl_ClipDistance array contains linearly interpolated values for the vertex values
written by a shader to the gl_ClipDistance vertex output variable. Only elements in this array that have
clipping enabled will have defined values.
The output variable gl_PrimitiveID is available only in the geometry language and provides a single
integer that serves as a primitive identifier. This is then available to fragment shaders as the fragment
input gl_PrimitiveID, which will select the written primitive ID from the provoking vertex in the primitive
being shaded. If a fragment shader using gl_PrimitiveID is active and a geometry shader is also active,
the geometry shader must write to gl_PrimitiveID or the fragment shader input gl_PrimitiveID is
undefined. See section 2.13.4 âGeometry Shader Execution Environmentâ (under âGeometry Shader
Outputsâ) and section 3.9.2 âShader Executionâ (under âShader Inputsâ) of the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification for more information.
For tessellation control and evaluation languages the input variable gl_PrimitiveID is filled with the
number of primitives processed by the shader since the current set of rendering primitives was started.
For the fragment language, it is filled with the value written to the gl_PrimitiveID geometry shader output
if a geometry shader is present. Otherwise, it is assigned in the same manner as with tessellation control
and evaluation shaders.
The geometry language input variable gl_PrimitiveIDIn behaves identically to the tessellation control and
evaluation language input variable gl_PrimitiveID.
The input variable gl_InvocationID is available only in the tessellation control and geometry languages.
In the tessellation control shader, it identifies the number of the output patch vertex assigned to the
tessellation control shader invocation. In the geometry shader, it identifies the invocation number
assigned to the geometry shader invocation. In both cases, gl_InvocationID is assigned integer values in
the range [0, N-1], where N is the number of output patch vertices or geometry shader invocations per
primitive.




                                               85
                                                                                     7 Built-in Variables



The output variable gl_Layer is available only in the geometry language, and is used to select a specific
layer (or face and layer of a cube map) of a multi-layer framebuffer attachment. The actual layer used will
come from one of the vertices in the primitive being shaded. Which vertex the layer comes from is
undefined, so it is best to write the same layer value for all vertices of a primitive. If a shader statically
assigns a value to gl_Layer, layered rendering mode is enabled. See section 2.13.4 âGeometry Shader
Execution Environmentâ (under âGeometry Shader Outputsâ) and section 4.4.7 âLayered Framebuffersâ
of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification for more information. If a shader statically assigns a value
to gl_Layer, and there is an execution path through the shader that does not set gl_Layer, then the value of
gl_Layer is undefined for executions of the shader that take that path.
The output variable gl_Layer takes on a special value when used with an array of cube map textures.
Instead of only referring to the layer, it is used to select a cube map face and a layer. Setting gl_Layer to
the value layer*6+face will render to face face of the cube defined in layer layer. The face values are
defined in Table 4.12 of section 4.4.7 âLayered Framebuffersâ of the OpenGL Graphics System
Specification, but repeated below for clarity.


               Face Value                      Resulting Target
                     0             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X
                     1             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X
                     2             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y
                     3             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y
                     4             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z
                     5             TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z

For example, to render to the positive y cube map face located in the 5th layer of the cube map array,
gl_Layer should be set to 5*6+2.
The variable gl_PatchVerticesIn is available only in the tessellation control and evaluation languages. It
is an integer specifying the number of vertices in the input patch being processed by the shader. A single
tessellation control or evaluation shader can read patches of differing sizes, so the value of
gl_PatchVerticesIn may differ between patches.
The output variables gl_TessLevelOuter[] and gl_TessLevelInner[] are available only in the tessellation
control language. The values written to these variables are assigned to the corresponding outer and inner
tessellation levels of the output patch. They are used by the tessellation primitive generator to control
primitive tessellation and may be read by tessellation evaluation shaders.
The variable gl_TessCoord is available only in the tessellation evaluation language. It specifies a three-
component (u,v,w) vector identifying the position of the vertex being processed by the shader relative to
the primitive being tessellated.
The input variables gl_TessLevelOuter[] and gl_TessLevelInner[] are available only in the tessellation
evaluation shader. If a tessellation control shader is active, these variables are filled with corresponding
outputs written by the tessellation control shader. Otherwise, they are assigned with default tessellation
levels specified in section 2.12 âTessellationâ in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification.




                                                86
                                                                                      7 Built-in Variables



Fragment shaders output values to the OpenGL pipeline using the built-in variables gl_FragColor,
gl_FragData, and gl_FragDepth, unless the discard statement is executed. Both gl_FragColor and
gl_FragData are deprecated; the preferred usage is to explicitly declare these outputs in the fragment
shader using the out storage qualifier.
The fixed functionality computed depth for a fragment may be obtained by reading gl_FragCoord.z,
described below.
Deprecated: Writing to gl_FragColor specifies the fragment color that will be used by the subsequent
fixed functionality pipeline. If subsequent fixed functionality consumes fragment color and an execution
of the fragment shader executable does not write a value to gl_FragColor then the fragment color
consumed is undefined.
Writing to gl_FragDepth will establish the depth value for the fragment being processed. If depth
buffering is enabled, and no shader writes gl_FragDepth, then the fixed function value for depth will be
used as the fragmentâs depth value. If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragDepth, and there is an
execution path through the shader that does not set gl_FragDepth, then the value of the fragmentâs depth
may be undefined for executions of the shader that take that path. That is, if the set of linked fragment
shaders statically contain a write to gl_FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.
Deprecated: The variable gl_FragData is an array. Writing to gl_FragData[n] specifies the fragment
data that will be used by the subsequent fixed functionality pipeline for data n. If subsequent fixed
functionality consumes fragment data and an execution of a fragment shader executable does not write a
value to it, then the fragment data consumed is undefined.
If a shader statically assigns a value to gl_FragColor, it may not assign a value to any element of
gl_FragData. If a shader statically writes a value to any element of gl_FragData, it may not assign a
value to gl_FragColor. That is, a shader may assign values to either gl_FragColor or gl_FragData, but
not both. Multiple shaders linked together must also consistently write just one of these variables.
Similarly, if user declared output variables are in use (statically assigned to), then the built-in variables
gl_FragColor and gl_FragData may not be assigned to. These incorrect usages all generate compile time
errors.
If a shader executes the discard keyword, the fragment is discarded, and the values of any user-defined
fragment outputs, gl_FragDepth, gl_FragColor, and gl_FragData become irrelevant.
The variable gl_FragCoord is available as an input variable from within fragment shaders and it holds the
window relative coordinates (x, y, z, 1/w) values for the fragment. If multi-sampling, this value can be for
any location within the pixel, or one of the fragment samples. The use of centroid in does not further
restrict this value to be inside the current primitive. This value is the result of the fixed functionality that
interpolates primitives after vertex processing to generate fragments. The z component is the depth value
that would be used for the fragmentâs depth if no shader contained any writes to gl_FragDepth. This is
useful for invariance if a shader conditionally computes gl_FragDepth but otherwise wants the fixed
functionality fragment depth.
Fragment shaders have access to the input built-in variable gl_FrontFacing, whose value is true if the
fragment belongs to a front-facing primitive. One use of this is to emulate two-sided lighting by selecting
one of two colors calculated by a vertex or geometry shader.




                                                 87
                                                                                             7 Built-in Variables



        The values in gl_PointCoord are two-dimensional coordinates indicating where within a point primitive
        the current fragment is located, when point sprites are enabled. They range from 0.0 to 1.0 across the
        point. If the current primitive is not a point, or if point sprites are not enabled, then the values read from
        gl_PointCoord are undefined.
        The output array gl_SampleMask[] sets the sample mask for the fragment being processed. Coverage for
        the current fragment will become the logical AND of the coverage mask and the output gl_SampleMask.
        Bit B of mask gl_SampleMask[M] corresponds to sample 32*M+B. This array must be sized in the
        fragment shader either implicitly or explicitly to be the same size as the implementation-dependent
        maximum sample-mask (as an array of 32bit elements), determined by the maximum number of samples.
        If the fragment shader statically assigns a value to gl_SampleMask, the sample mask will be undefined for
        any array elements of any fragment shader invocations that fail to assign a value. If a shader does not
        statically assign a value to gl_SampleMask, the sample mask has no effect on the processing of a
        fragment.
        The input variable gl_SampleID is filled with the sample number of the sample currently being processed.
        This variable is in the range 0 to gl_NumSamples-1, where gl_NumSamples is the total number of samples
        in the framebuffer, or 1 if rendering to a non-multisample framebuffer. Any static use of this variable in a
        fragment shader causes the entire shader to be evaluated per-sample.
        The input variable gl_SamplePosition contains the position of the current sample within the multi-sample
        draw buffer. The x and y components of gl_SamplePosition contain the sub-pixel coordinate of the current
        sample and will have values in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Any static use of this variable in a fragment shader
        causes the entire shader to be evaluated per sample.

7.1.1   Compatibility Profile Built-In Language Variables
        When using the compatibility profile, the GL can provide fixed functionality behavior for the vertex and
        fragment programmable pipeline stages. For example, mixing a fixed functionality vertex stage with a
        programmable fragment stage.
        The following built-in vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, and geometry output variables
        are available to specify inputs for the subsequent programmable shader stage or the fixed functionality
        fragment stage. A particular one should be written to if any functionality in a corresponding fragment
        shader or fixed pipeline uses it or state derived from it. Otherwise, behavior is undefined. The following
        members are added to the output gl_PerVertex block in these languages:
           out gl_PerVertex {       // part of the gl_PerVertex block described in 7.1
               // in addition to other gl_PerVertex members...
               vec4 gl_ClipVertex;
               vec4 gl_FrontColor;
               vec4 gl_BackColor;
               vec4 gl_FrontSecondaryColor;
               vec4 gl_BackSecondaryColor;
               vec4 gl_TexCoord[];
               float gl_FogFragCoord;
           };

        The output variable gl_ClipVertex provides a place for vertex and geometry shaders to write the
        coordinate to be used with the user clipping planes.




                                                        88
                                                                                    7 Built-in Variables



The user must ensure the clip vertex and user clipping planes are defined in the same coordinate space.
User clip planes work properly only under linear transform. It is undefined what happens under non-
linear transform.
If a linked set of shaders forming a program contains no static write to gl_ClipVertex or gl_ClipDistance,
but the application has requested clipping against user clip planes through the API, then the coordinate
written to gl_Position is used for comparison against the user clip planes. Writing to gl_ClipDistance is
the preferred method for user clipping. It is an error for the set of shaders forming a program to statically
read or write both gl_ClipVertex and gl_ClipDistance.
The output variables gl_FrontColor, glFrontSecondaryColor, gl_BackColor, and glBackSecondaryColor
assign primary and secondary colors for front and back faces of primitives containing the vertex being
processed. The output variable gl_TexCoord assigns texture coordinates for the vertex being processed.
For gl_FogFragCoord, the value written will be used as the âcâ value in section 3.11 âFogâ of the
compatibility profile of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, by the fixed functionality pipeline.
For example, if the z-coordinate of the fragment in eye space is desired as âcâ, then that's what the vertex
shader executable should write into gl_FogFragCoord.
As with all arrays, indices used to subscript gl_TexCoord must either be an integral constant expressions,
or this array must be re-declared by the shader with a size. The size can be at most
gl_MaxTextureCoords. Using indexes close to 0 may aid the implementation in preserving varying
resources. The redeclaration of gl_TexCoord is done at global scope as, for example,
   in vec4 gl_TexCoord[3];
   out vec4 gl_TexCoord[4];

which is the same way it was done in previous releases. This treatment is a special case for
gl_TexCoord[], not a general method for redeclaring members of blocks.
In the tessellation control, evaluation, and geometry shaders, the outputs of the previous stage described
above are also available in the input gl_PerVertex block in these languages.


   in gl_PerVertex {        // part of the gl_PerVertex block described in 7.1
       // in addition to other gl_PerVertex members...
       vec4 gl_ClipVertex;
       vec4 gl_FrontColor;
       vec4 gl_BackColor;
       vec4 gl_FrontSecondaryColor;
       vec4 gl_BackSecondaryColor;
       vec4 gl_TexCoord[];
       float gl_FogFragCoord;
   } gl_in[];


The following fragment inputs are also available in a fragment shader when using the compatibility
profile:




                                                89
                                                                                          7 Built-in Variables



         in   float   gl_FogFragCoord;
         in   vec4    gl_TexCoord[];
         in   vec4    gl_Color;
         in   vec4    gl_SecondaryColor;

      The values in gl_Color and gl_SecondaryColor will be derived automatically by the system from
      gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor, gl_FrontSecondaryColor, and gl_BackSecondaryColor based on which
      face is visible in the primitive producing the fragment. If fixed functionality is used for vertex processing,
      then gl_FogFragCoord will either be the z-coordinate of the fragment in eye space, or the interpolation of
      the fog coordinate, as described in section 3.11 âFogâ of the compatibility profile of the OpenGL
      Graphics System Specification. The gl_TexCoord[] values are the interpolated gl_TexCoord[] values
      from a vertex shader or the texture coordinates of any fixed pipeline based vertex functionality.
      Indices to the fragment shader gl_TexCoord array are as described above in the vertex shader text.

7.2   Compatibility Profile Vertex Shader Built-In Inputs
      The following predeclared input names can be used from within a vertex shader to access the current
      values of OpenGL state when using the compatibility profile.
         in   vec4    gl_Color;
         in   vec4    gl_SecondaryColor;
         in   vec3    gl_Normal;

         in   float   gl_FogCoord;


7.3   Built-In Constants
      The following built-in constants are provided to all shaders. The actual values used are implementation
      dependent, but must be at least the value shown. Some are deprecated, as indicated in comments.

8 Built-in Functions

   The OpenGL Shading Language defines an assortment of built-in convenience functions for scalar and
   vector operations. Many of these built-in functions can be used in more than one type of shader, but some
   are intended to provide a direct mapping to hardware and so are available only for a specific type of
   shader.
   The built-in functions basically fall into three categories:
   â¢   They expose some necessary hardware functionality in a convenient way such as accessing a texture
       map. There is no way in the language for these functions to be emulated by a shader.
   â¢   They represent a trivial operation (clamp, mix, etc.) that is very simple for the user to write, but they
       are very common and may have direct hardware support. It is a very hard problem for the compiler to
       map expressions to complex assembler instructions.
   â¢   They represent an operation graphics hardware is likely to accelerate at some point. The trigonometry
       functions fall into this category.
   Many of the functions are similar to the same named ones in common C libraries, but they support vector
   input as well as the more traditional scalar input.
   Applications should be encouraged to use the built-in functions rather than do the equivalent computations
   in their own shader code since the built-in functions are assumed to be optimal (e.g., perhaps supported
   directly in hardware).
   User code can replace built-in functions with their own if they choose, by simply re-declaring and defining
   the same name and argument list. Because built-in functions are in a more outer scope than user built-in
   functions, doing this will hide all built-in functions with the same name as the re-declared function.
   When the built-in functions are specified below, where the input arguments (and corresponding output)
   can be float, vec2, vec3, or vec4, genType is used as the argument. Where the input arguments (and
   corresponding output) can be int, ivec2, ivec3, or ivec4, genIType is used as the argument. Where the
   input arguments (and corresponding output) can be uint, uvec2, uvec3, or uvec4, genUType is used as the
   argument. Where the input arguments (or corresponding output) can be bool, bvec2, bvec3, or bvec4,
   genBType is used as the argument. Where the input arguments (and corresponding output) can be double,
   dvec2, dvec3, dvec4, genDType is used as the argument. For any specific use of a function, the actual
   types substituted for genType, genIType, genUType, or genBType have to have the same number of
   components for all arguments and for the return type. Similarly, mat is used for any matrix basic type
   with single-precision components and dmat is used for any matrix basic type with double-precision
   components.

8.1   Angle and Trigonometry Functions
      Function parameters specified as angle are assumed to be in units of radians. In no case will any of these
      functions result in a divide by zero error. If the divisor of a ratio is 0, then results will be undefined.
      These all operate component-wise. The description is per component.

       genType floor (genType x)                    Returns a value equal to the nearest integer that is less
       genDType floor (genDType x)                  than or equal to x.

       genType trunc (genType x)                    Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to x whose
       genDType trunc (genDType x)                  absolute value is not larger than the absolute value of x.

       genType round (genType x)                    Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to x. The
       genDType round (genDType x)                  fraction 0.5 will round in a direction chosen by the
                                                    implementation, presumably the direction that is fastest.
                                                    This includes the possibility that round(x) returns the
                                                    same value as roundEven(x) for all values of x.

       genType roundEven (genType x)                Returns a value equal to the nearest integer to x. A
       genDType roundEven (genDType x)              fractional part of 0.5 will round toward the nearest even
                                                    integer. (Both 3.5 and 4.5 for x will return 4.0.)

       genType ceil (genType x)                     Returns a value equal to the nearest integer that is
       genDType ceil (genDType x)                   greater than or equal to x.

8.4   Floating-Point Pack and Unpack Functions
      These functions do not operate component-wise, rather as described in each case.

       Syntax                                         Description
       uint packUnorm2x16 (vec2 v)                   First, converts each component of the normalized
       uint packUnorm4x8 (vec4 v)                    floating-point value v into 8- or 16-bit integer values.
       uint packSnorm4x8 (vec4 v)                    Then, the results are packed into the returned 32-bit
                                                     unsigned integer.
                                                     The conversion for component c of v to fixed point is
                                                     done as follows:
                                                        packUnorm2x16: round(clamp(c, 0, +1) * 65535.0)
                                                        packUnorm4x8: round(clamp(c, 0, +1) * 255.0)
                                                        packSnorm4x8: round(clamp(c, -1, +1) * 127.0)

                                                     The first component of the vector will be written to the
                                                     least significant bits of the output; the last component
                                                     will be written to the most significant bits.


       vec2 unpackUnorm2x16 (uint p)                 First, unpacks a single 32-bit unsigned integer p into a
       vec4 unpackUnorm4x8 (uint p)                  pair of 16-bit unsigned integers, four 8-bit unsigned
       vec4 unpackSnorm4x8 (uint p)                  integers, or four 8-bit signed integers. Then, each
                                                     component is converted to a normalized floating-point
                                                     value to generate the returned two- or four-component
                                                     vector.

                                                     The conversion for unpacked fixed-point value f to
                                                     floating point is done as follows:

                                                         unpackUnorm2x16: f / 65535.0
                                                         unpackUnorm4x8: f / 255.0
                                                         unpackSnorm4x8: clamp(f / 127.0, -1, +1)

                                                     The first component of the returned vector will be

8.9   Texture Functions
      Texture lookup functions are available in all shading stages. However, automatic level of detail is
      computed only for fragment shaders. Other shaders operate as though the base level of detail were
      computed as zero. The functions in the table below provide access to textures through samplers, as set up
      through the OpenGL API. Texture properties such as size, pixel format, number of dimensions, filtering
      method, number of mip-map levels, depth comparison, and so on are also defined by OpenGL API calls.
      Such properties are taken into account as the texture is accessed via the built-in functions defined below.
      Texture data can be stored by the GL as floating point, unsigned normalized integer, unsigned integer or
      signed integer data. This is determined by the type of the internal format of the texture. Texture lookups
      on unsigned normalized integer and floating point data return floating point values in the range [0, 1].
      Texture lookup functions are provided that can return their result as floating point, unsigned integer or
      signed integer, depending on the sampler type passed to the lookup function. Care must be taken to use
      the right sampler type for texture access. The following table lists the supported combinations of sampler
      types and texture internal formats. Blank entries are unsupported. Doing a texture lookup will return
      undefined values for unsupported combinations.


                                        Floating Point      Signed Integer       Unsigned Integer
            Internal Texture Format

            Floating point                  Supported
            Normalized Integer              Supported
            Signed Integer                                       Supported
            Unsigned Integer                                                         Supported


      If an integer sampler type is used, the result of a texture lookup is an ivec4. If an unsigned integer sampler
      type is used, the result of a texture lookup is a uvec4. If a floating point sampler type is used, the result of
      a texture lookup is a vec4, where each component is in the range [0, 1].
      In the prototypes below, the âgâ in the return type âgvec4â is used as a placeholder for nothing, âiâ, or âuâ
      making a return type of vec4, ivec4, or uvec4. In these cases, the sampler argument type also starts with
      âgâ, indicating the same substitution done on the return type; it is either a floating point, signed integer, or
      unsigned integer sampler, matching the basic type of the return type, as described above.
      For shadow forms (the sampler parameter is a shadow-type), a depth comparison lookup on the depth
      texture bound to sampler is done as described in section 3.8.16 âTexture Comparison Modesâ of the
      OpenGL Graphics System Specification. See the table below for which component specifies Dref. The
      texture bound to sampler must be a depth texture, or results are undefined. If a non-shadow texture call is
      made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth comparisons turned on, then results are
      undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that represents a depth texture with depth
      comparisons turned off, then results are undefined. If a shadow texture call is made to a sampler that does
      not represent a depth texture, then results are undefined.

                                                                                           8 Built-in Functions



        In all functions below, the bias parameter is optional for fragment shaders. The bias parameter is not
        accepted in any other shaders. For a fragment shader, if bias is present, it is added to the implicit level of
        detail prior to performing the texture access operation. No bias or lod parameters for rectangular textures,
        multi-sample textures, or texture buffers are supported because mip-maps are not allowed for these types
        of textures.
        The implicit level of detail is selected as follows: For a texture that is not mip-mapped, the texture is used
        directly. If it is mip-mapped and running in a fragment shader, the LOD computed by the implementation
        is used to do the texture lookup. If it is mip-mapped and running on the vertex shader, then the base
        texture is used.
        Some texture functions (non-âLodâ and non-âGradâ versions) may require implicit derivatives. Implicit
        derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow and for non-fragment-shader texture fetches.
        For Cube forms, the direction of P is used to select which face to do a 2-dimensional texture lookup in, as
        described in section 3.8.10 âCube Map Texture Selectionâ in the OpenGL Graphics System Specification.
        For Array forms, the array layer used will be
          max î0,min îd â1, floorîlayerî0.5îîî
        where d is the depth of the texture array and layer comes from the component indicated in the tables
        below.

8.9.1   Texture Query Functions
        The textureSize functions query the dimensions of a specific texture level for a sampler.
        The textureQueryLod functions are available only in a fragment shader. They take the components of P
        and compute the level of detail information that the texture pipe would use to access that texture through a
        normal texture lookup. The level of detail Î»' (equation 3.18 in the OpenGL Graphics System
        Specification) is obtained after any LOD bias, but prior to clamping to [TEXTURE_MIN_LOD,
        TEXTURE_MAX_LOD]. The mipmap array(s) that would be accessed are also computed. If a single
        level of detail would be accessed, the level-of-detail number relative to the base level is returned. If
        multiple levels of detail would be accessed, a floating-point number between the two levels is returned,
        with the fractional part equal to the fractional part of the computed and clamped level of detail. The
        algorithm used is given by the following pseudo-code:

   float ComputeAccessedLod(float computedLod)
   {
       // Clamp the computed LOD according to the texture LOD clamps.
       if (computedLod < TEXTURE_MIN_LOD) computedLod = TEXTURE_MIN_LOD;
       if (computedLod > TEXTURE_MAX_LOD) computedLod = TEXTURE_MAX_LOD;

        // Clamp the computed LOD to the range of accessible levels.
        if (computedLod < 0)
            computedLod = 0.0;
        if (computedLod > (float)
            maxAccessibleLevel) computedLod = (float) maxAccessibleLevel;

        // Return a value according to the min filter.
        if (TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is LINEAR or NEAREST) {
            return 0.0;
        } else if (TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST
                   or LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST) {
            return ceil(computedLod + 0.5) - 1.0;
        } else {
            return computedLod;
        }
   }

The value maxAccessibleLevel is the level number of the smallest accessible level of the mipmap array
(the value q in section 3.8.9 âTexture Minificationâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification) minus
the base level.

8.9.3   Texture Gather Instructions
        The texture gather functions take components of a single floating-point vector operand as a texture
        coordinate, determine a set of four texels to sample from the base level of detail of the specified texture
        image, and return one component from each texel in a four-component result vector.
        When performing a texture gather operation, the minification and magnification filters are ignored, and
        the rules for LINEAR filtering in the OpenGL Specification are applied to the base level of the texture
        image to identify the four texels i0j1, i1j1, i1j0, and i0j0. The texels are then converted to texture source
        colors (Rs, Gs, Bs, As) according to Table 3.20, followed by application of the texture swizzle as described
        in Section 3.9.2 âShader Executionâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification. A four-component
        vector is assembled by taking the selected component from each of the swizzled texture source colors in
        the order (i0j1, i1j1, i1j0, i0j0).
        For texture gather functions using a shadow sampler type, each of the four texel lookups performs a depth
        comparison against the depth reference value passed in (refZ), and returns the result of that comparison in
        the appropriate component of the result vector.
        As with other texture lookup functions, the results of a texture gather are undefined for shadow samplers if
        the texture referenced is not a depth texture or has depth comparisons disabled; or for non-shadow
        samplers if the texture referenced is a depth texture with depth comparisons enabled.

8.10   Fragment Processing Functions
       Fragment processing functions are only available in fragment shaders.

8.10.1 Derivative Functions
       Derivatives may be computationally expensive and/or numerically unstable. Therefore, an OpenGL
       implementation may approximate the true derivatives by using a fast but not entirely accurate derivative
       computation. Derivatives are undefined within non-uniform control flow.
       The expected behavior of a derivative is specified using forward/backward differencing.
       Forward differencing:
            F î xîdxîâF î xî ~ dFdxî xîâdx           1a
                        F î xîdxîâF î xî
           dFdxî xî ~                                1b
                               dx


       Backward differencing:
           F î xâdxîâF î xî ~âdFdxî xîâdx            2a
                        F î xîâF îxâdxî
           dFdxî xî ~                                2b
                               dx


       With single-sample rasterization, dx <= 1.0 in equations 1b and 2b. For multi-sample rasterization, dx <
       2.0 in equations 1b and 2b.
       dFdy is approximated similarly, with y replacing x.
       A GL implementation may use the above or other methods to perform the calculation, subject to the
       following conditions:
       1. The method may use piecewise linear approximations. Such linear approximations imply that higher
          order derivatives, dFdx(dFdx(x)) and above, are undefined.
       2. The method may assume that the function evaluated is continuous. Therefore derivatives within non-
          uniform control flow are undefined.
       3. The method may differ per fragment, subject to the constraint that the method may vary by window
          coordinates, not screen coordinates. The invariance requirement described in section 3.2 âInvarianceâ
          of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification, is relaxed for derivative calculations, because the
          method may be a function of fragment location.
       Other properties that are desirable, but not required, are:
       4. Functions should be evaluated within the interior of a primitive (interpolated, not extrapolated).
       5. Functions for dFdx should be evaluated while holding y constant. Functions for dFdy should be
          evaluated while holding x constant. However, mixed higher order derivatives, like dFdx(dFdy(y))
          and dFdy(dFdx(x)) are undefined.

                                                                                           8 Built-in Functions



       6. Derivatives of constant arguments should be 0.
       In some implementations, varying degrees of derivative accuracy may be obtained by providing GL hints
       (section 5.4 âHintsâ of the OpenGL Graphics System Specification), allowing a user to make an image
       quality versus speed trade off.


        Syntax                                            Description
        genType dFdx (genType p)                         Returns the derivative in x using local differencing for
                                                         the input argument p.


        genType dFdy (genType p)                         Returns the derivative in y using local differencing for
                                                         the input argument p.

                                                         These two functions are commonly used to estimate the
                                                         filter width used to anti-alias procedural textures. We
                                                         are assuming that the expression is being evaluated in
                                                         parallel on a SIMD array so that at any given point in
                                                         time the value of the function is known at the grid points
                                                         represented by the SIMD array. Local differencing
                                                         between SIMD array elements can therefore be used to
                                                         derive dFdx, dFdy, etc.

        genType fwidth (genType p)                       Returns the sum of the absolute derivative in x and y
                                                         using local differencing for the input argument p, i.e.,
                                                         abs (dFdx (p)) + abs (dFdy (p));




8.10.2 Interpolation Functions
       Built-in interpolation functions are available to compute an interpolated value of a fragment shader input
       variable at a shader-specified (x, y) location. A separate (x, y) location may be used for each invocation of
       the built-in function, and those locations may differ from the default (x, y) location used to produce the
       default value of the input.
       For all of the interpolation functions, interpolant must be an input variable or an element of an input
       variable declared as an array. Component selection operators (e.g., .xy) may not be used when specifying
       interpolant. If interpolant is declared with a flat or centroid qualifier, the qualifier will have no effect on
       the interpolated value. If interpolant is declared with the noperspective qualifier, the interpolated value
       will be computed without perspective correction.

           Syntax                                              Description
           float interpolateAtCentroid (float interpolant)     Return the value of the input varying interpolant
           vec2 interpolateAtCentroid (vec2 interpolant)       sampled at a location inside the both the pixel and the
           vec3 interpolateAtCentroid (vec3 interpolant)       primitive being processed. The value obtained would
           vec4 interpolateAtCentroid (vec4 interpolant)       be the same value assigned to the input variable if
                                                               declared with the centroid qualifier.


           float interpolateAtSample (float interpolant,       Return the value of the input varying interpolant at
                                      int sample)              the location of sample number sample. If
           vec2 interpolateAtSample (vec2 interpolant,         multisample buffers are not available, the input
                                      int sample)              varying will be evaluated at the center of the pixel. If
           vec3 interpolateAtSample (vec3 interpolant,         sample sample does not exist, the position used to
                                      int sample)              interpolate the input varying is undefined.

           float interpolateAtOffset (float interpolant,       Return the value of the input varying interpolant
                                      vec2 offset)             sampled an offset from the center of the pixel
           vec2 interpolateAtOffset (vec2 interpolant,         specificed by offset. The two floating-point
                                      vec2 offset)             components of offset, give the offset in pixels in the x
           vec3 interpolateAtOffset (vec3 interpolant,         and y directions, respectively. An offset of (0, 0)
                                      vec2 offset)             identifies the center of the pixel. The range and
           vec4 interpolateAtOffset (vec4 interpolant,         granularity of offsets supported by this function is
                                      vec2 offset)             implementation-dependent.




8.11   Noise Functions
       Noise functions are available to fragment, geometry, and vertex shaders. They are stochastic functions that
       can be used to increase visual complexity. Values returned by the following noise functions give the
       appearance of randomness, but are not truly random. The noise functions below are defined to have the
       following characteristics:
       â¢     The return value(s) are always in the range [-1.0,1.0], and cover at least the range [-0.6, 0.6], with a
             Gaussian-like distribution.
       â¢     The return value(s) have an overall average of 0.0
       â¢     They are repeatable, in that a particular input value will always produce the same return value
       â¢     They are statistically invariant under rotation (i.e., no matter how the domain is rotated, it has the same
             statistical character)
       â¢     They have a statistical invariance under translation (i.e., no matter how the domain is translated, it has
             the same statistical character)
       â¢     They typically give different results under translation.

8.12   Geometry Shader Functions
       These functions are only available in geometry shaders. They are described in more depth following the
       table.

        Syntax                                      Description
        void EmitStreamVertex (int stream)          Emit the current values of output variables to the current
                                                    output primitive on stream stream. The argument to stream
                                                    must be a constant integral expression. On return from this
                                                    call, the values of all output variables are undefined.
                                                    Can only be used if multiple output streams are supported.


        void EndStreamPrimitive (int stream)        Completes the current output primitive on stream stream and
                                                    starts a new one. The argument to stream must be a constant
                                                    integral expression. No vertex is emitted.
                                                    Can only be used if multiple output streams are supported.


        void EmitVertex ()                          Emit the current values of output variables to the current
                                                    output primitive. On return from this call, the values of
                                                    output variables are undefined.
                                                    When multiple output streams are supported, this is
                                                    equivalent to calling EmitStreamVertex(0).


        void EndPrimitive ()                        Completes the current output primitive and starts a new one.
                                                    No vertex is emitted.
                                                    When multiple output streams are supported, this is
                                                    equivalent to calling EndStreamPrimitive(0).



       The function EmitStreamVertex() specifies that a vertex is completed. A vertex is added to the current
       output primitive in vertex stream stream using the current values of all output variables associated with
       stream. The values of all output variables for all output streams are undefined after a call to
       EmitStreamVertex(). If a geometry shader invocation has emitted more vertices than permitted by the
       output layout qualifier max_vertices, the results of calling EmitStreamVertex() are undefined.
       The function EndStreamPrimitive() specifies that the current output primitive for vertex stream stream is
       completed and a new output primitive (of the same type) will started by any subsequent
       EmitStreamVertex(). This function does not emit a vertex. If the output layout is declared to be
       âpointsâ, calling EndStreamPrimitive() is optional.
       A geometry shader starts with an output primitive containing no vertices for each stream. When a
       geometry shader terminates, the current output primitive for each stream is automatically completed. It is
       not necessary to call EndStreamPrimitive() if the geometry shader writes only a single primitive.

Multiple output streams are supported only if the output primitive type is declared to be points. A
program will fail to link if it contains a geometry shader calling EmitStreamVertex() or
EndStreamPrimitive() if its input primitive type is not points.

                                                                                          8 Built-in Functions



8.13   Shader Invocation Control Functions
       The shader invocation control function is available only in tessellation control shaders. It is used to
       control the relative execution order of multiple shader invocations used to process a patch, which are
       otherwise executed with an undefined relative order.

        Syntax                         Description
        void barrier ()                For any given static instance of barrier(), all tessellation control shader
                                       invocations for a single input patch must enter it before any will be
                                       allowed to continue beyond it.



       The function barrier() provides a partially defined order of execution between shader invocations. This
       ensures that values written by one invocation prior to a given static instance of barrier() can be safely
       read by other invocations after their call to the same static instance barrier(). Because invocations may
       execute in undefined order between these barrier calls, the values of a per-vertex or per-patch output
       variable will be undefined in a number of cases enumerated in section 4.3.6 âOutputsâ.
       The barrier() function may only be placed inside the function main() of the tessellation control shader
       and may not be called within any control flow. Barriers are also disallowed after a return statement in the
       function main().
